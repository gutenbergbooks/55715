<p class="ph3">A CLOSE GAME</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Come</span> on now, Bateye, soak it in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, are you going to hold that ball all day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you; didn&#8217;t you ever see a
horsehide before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for the love of Mike! Throw it! Throw it! Do
you want to give &#8217;em a run?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way! Wake up, Bateye!&#8221;</p>

<p>These were only a few of the expressions and questions
hurled by the other players at Bateye Jones, the Freeport
rightfielder, who, after running back to recover a ball that
had passed high over his head, was holding the sphere
for a moment until he had made sure of the position of
the runner, Jake Jensen, of the Vandalia team.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw it! Throw it! You can take a picture of it
after the game!&#8221; howled Captain John Smith of the Freeport
nine, as he danced about behind home plate, and saw
Tom Evans come in from third, and noticed Jensen legging
it around from second.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Bateye threw, and, mingling with the cries of the
players and the yells of the crowd, there were groans of
anguish as the ball passed high over the second baseman&#8217;s
head, who jumped for it in vain.</p>

<p>Bill Smith, the wiry little pitcher, made a successful
grab for the horsehide as it bounced on the ground, captured
it, and hurled it to third, just in time to catch
Jensen there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out!&#8221; yelled the umpire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, say, I beat it a mile!&#8221; protested the panting
runner. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Foster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out,&#8221; said the umpire again, waving his hand to indicate
that Jensen was to leave the bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ll leave it to anybody if I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on in,&#8221; invited Rube Mantell, captain of the
Vandalias in a weary tone, and Jake shuffled to the bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty lucky stop, Bill,&#8221; called Pete, or &#8220;Sawed-off&#8221;
Smith, to his brother the pitcher. The small-statured
lad again took his position at short stop which he had
left for a moment. &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s the matter with
Bateye to-day? That&#8217;s the second error he&#8217;s made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess he got a bit rattled with so many howling
at him,&#8221; spoke Bill good-naturedly. &#8220;Come on now,
Pete. There are two down, and we ought to wallop &#8217;em
easy when it comes our turn. Watch me strike Flub Madison
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill, who was the best pitcher the Freeport team had
secured in several seasons, again took his place in the
box, while his brother John, or &#8220;Cap&#8221; from the likeness
of his name to that of the old Indian fighter, resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
his mask, after shooting a few indignant looks in the direction
of the unfortunate Bateye Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got to improve if he wants to stay on the team,&#8221;
murmured Cap Smith as he waited for the next ball. &#8220;I
s&#8217;pose he&#8217;ll excuse himself by saying the sun was in his
eyes, or something like that. Or else that he can&#8217;t see
well in the daytime. He certainly can see good at night.
Old Bateye&mdash;well, here goes for the next one,&#8221; and Cap
plumped his fist into the big mitt, and signalled to his
pitching brother to send in a slow out curve to Flub Madison
who took his place at the plate.</p>

<p>It was the ending of the eighth inning, and the score
was seven to six, in favor of the Freeport lads. The game
was far from won, for their opponents were playing
strong, and still had another, and last, chance at the bat.
To win meant much for the team on which the Smith
Boys played, for they wanted to capture the championship
of the County League, this being one of the last games
of the season.</p>

<p>&#8220;One ball!&#8221; hoarsely called the umpire, as Bill unwound,
and sent the horsehide sphere plump into the mitt of his
older brother.</p>

<p>Cap looked an indignant protest, and hesitated as he
tossed the ball back. It was as clean a strike as could
be desired, but it was not the first time the official had
favored Vandalia that day. The game was on their
grounds, and the rivalry that existed between the two
cities, located on either side of the Waydell river, was
carried even into baseball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make him give you a nice one, Flub,&#8221; called some of
his friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;ll walk you, anyhow,&#8221; added another sarcastically.</p>

<p>Bill Smith gritted his teeth but said nothing. He
shook his head as his brother signalled for the same kind
of a ball, and sent in a swift drop. Flub bit at it, and
swung viciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike one!&#8221; sounded sweet to the ears of the pitcher
and catcher.</p>

<p>There was a vicious &#8220;ping&#8221; as the next ball was sailing
over the plate, and for a moment the hearts of the Freeport
nine and the hopes of their supporters were like
lead, but they turned to rejoicing an instant later, as they
saw the ball shoot high over the extreme left grandstand,
and disappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foul strike!&#8221; called the umpire, as he tossed a new
ball to Bill.</p>

<p>Cap signalled for the fast drop, and his brother nodded
in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three strikes! Batter out!&#8221; was yelled a moment later
and Flub threw down his stick in disgust, and walked toward
the outfield.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s our last chance!&#8221; exclaimed Bill to John, as
he came running in, while the teams changed places. &#8220;We
ought to get at least three runs&mdash;in fact we need &#8217;em if
we&#8217;re going to win, for they&#8217;ve got three of their best hitters
up when they come for their last dips. But if we
can get a lead of four runs we&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll be all right if Bateye doesn&#8217;t go to sleep
again,&#8221; grumbled Cap. &#8220;Say, what&#8217;s the matter with
you?&#8221; he demanded as the unlucky rightfielder filed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er I&mdash;that is I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, out with it! You&#8217;re holding that talk as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
you held the ball. Don&#8217;t do it again!&#8221; and Cap, who
never could be ill-natured for very long, condescended to
smile, while Bateye promised to do better in the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Doc, show &#8217;em how to make a home run,&#8221; suggested
Pete, as Harry or &#8220;Doc&#8221; Norton, dubbed with the
medical term by virtue of his father&#8217;s profession, came up
to the bat. Doc tried hard, but only got a single. He was
advanced to third when Norton Tonkin rapped out a nice
two bagger, but that was as far as luck went for the
Freeport nine that day. The next three players struck
out under the masterly pitching of Nifty Pell, and the
three Smith Boys did not get a chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re one run to the good. If we can hold &#8217;em
down the game&#8217;s ours,&#8221; observed Pete, as he walked out
with his brothers, followed by the rest of the team. &#8220;It&#8217;s
up to you, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that, Sawed-off,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do my
best, but I can&#8217;t play the whole game. Crimps! But I
<i>would</i> like to win this game! They&#8217;ve been making so
many cracks about putting it all over us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to win!&#8221; said Cap Smith fiercely. &#8220;We
need this to help us get the pennant. Don&#8217;t get nervous
Bill, and you can do &#8217;em. Try that up shoot on Scurry
Nelson.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last half of the ninth inning began. There were
agonized appeals from the Vandalia supporters for the
nine to cinch the tying run, and then to bring in half a
dozen more for good luck.</p>

<p>&#8220;They shan&#8217;t do it, if I can help it!&#8221; murmured Bill
Smith half-savagely, as he took his place.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Noticing the manner in which Bill stung in a few practice
balls his brother behind the plate smiled happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill hasn&#8217;t lost any speed,&#8221; he thought gleefully.</p>

<p>Scurry Nelson swung with all his force at the first ball,
and his bat passed neatly under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike one!&#8221; came from the umpire, as if it made no
difference to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only two more!&#8221; howled the supporters of the Freeport
nine. &#8220;You can do it, Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill tried the same kind of a curve again, and got away
with it, but on the third attempt, after giving a ball on
purpose, he heard the fatal &#8220;ping&#8221; and a swift grounder
got past Pete.</p>

<p>There were groans of dismay from part of the crowd,
accompanied by howls of delight from the other half, as
Scurry landed on first. Bill felt his heart wildly beating,
and Cap thumped his big glove viciously.</p>

<p>The Vandalia team on the bench was in transports of
joy. Already they saw their enemies vanquished. Bill
calmed himself by an effort, and even smiled as he faced
Buck Wheeler the next man up. Buck was a notoriously
heavy hitter and it seemed as if he would knock the cover
off the ball when he swung at the first one Bill sent in.
Only he didn&#8217;t hit it.</p>

<p>And he didn&#8217;t hit the next two, either, though he made
desperate efforts to do so, and there was not quite so
much elation on the faces of the Vandaliaites as the next
man got up. He knocked a little pop fly, which Bill
caught with ease making two out and, as quick as a flash the
pitcher turned and threw to second, toward which bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Scurry was legging it for all he was worth. Bill was just
a second too late, however and the runner was safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two down! Only one more, and the game is ours!&#8221;
came the encouraging yells from the grandstand where
the Freeport supporters were crowded.</p>

<p>Bill smiled happily and got ready for the next man,
at the same time watching Scurry on second. The following
player was Will Longton, and had a high batting
average. There was a smile of confidence on his face as
he stepped to the plate.</p>

<p>Bill sent in a puzzling twister, and Will smiled as he
refused to bite at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ball,&#8221; called the umpire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it easy! He&#8217;s afraid, and he&#8217;ll walk you,&#8221; was
the advice Will got. He was still smiling confidently when
the next ball whizzed past him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike,&#8221; came from the umpire, with obvious reluctance,
since he wanted to see his friends win. Will looked
an indignant protest at the official, and rubbed some dirt
on his hands, so that he might better grip the bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch him soak the cover off!&#8221; howled an enthusiastic
admirer.</p>

<p>Longton did hit it, but only a foul resulted, and Scurry,
who had started for third, had to come back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how to do it, Bill,&#8221; called the catcher to
his brother, giving him a sign. Bill nodded, and the next
instant, amid a breathless silence a swift ball shot from
his hand, straight for the plate.</p>

<p>With an intaking of breath Will Longton swung at it
with such force that he turned completely around, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
look of astonishment on his face was mirth-provoking, as
he realized that he had missed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pung!&#8221; went the ball as it settled into the pit of Cap
Smith&#8217;s glove, and the voice of the umpire, as he called
&#8220;Three strikes&mdash;batter out!&#8221; was lost in the howl of delight
that welled up from grand stands and bleachers as
the crowd realized that Freeport had held their opponents
down in the last inning, and had won the game. What if
it was only by one run? One run has often won a league
championship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great work, Bill!&#8221; cried Pete as he ran in, clapping
his brother on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; agreed Cap, as he hugged the pitcher.
&#8220;We did &#8217;em! Come on now, we can catch the next boat
across the river if we get a move on,&#8221; and the Smith boys,
followed by the rest of the team, hastened to the dressing
rooms, stopping only long enough to return the cheer
which their opponents gave them.</p>

<p>The crowd was surging down from the stands, talking
about the close game, discussing the best plays, arguing
how if such a man had done differently the result would
have been changed, and speculating as to Freeport&#8217;s and
Vandalia&#8217;s chances for winning the pennant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you fellows going to do to-night?&#8221; asked
Bateye Jones a little later as he stood talking with his
chums, the Smith Boys on the little ferry boat which ran
across the river from Vandalia to Freeport.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing special, I guess. Why?&#8221; inquired Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say if we give the fire department a run?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em a run?&#8221; asked Cap with a puzzled air. &#8220;What
do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>&#8220;Why they haven&#8217;t been out in nearly two weeks, and
they&#8217;re just waiting for a chance to show off their new
uniforms, and try the new chemical,&#8221; spoke Bateye. &#8220;I
say let&#8217;s give it to &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Pete, who detected a gleam of fun in
the half-closed eyes of the lad who had such a habit of
being out nights, and such a reputed ability to see in the
dark, that it had gained him the name of Bateye. &#8220;How
you going to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy. Come over here, and I&#8217;ll tell you. Come on,
Doc, and you, too, Norton.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads thus addressed, together with the Smith
boys, moved forward on the little boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Spider Langdon and Beantoe Pudder looking
at us,&#8221; explained Bateye, when they were safe in a corner
of the craft, &#8220;and I didn&#8217;t want them to get on to us.
Now here&#8217;s my scheme. We can have some fun, and, at
the same time give the department a chance to show off,&#8221;
and with that Bateye began to whisper the details of his
plan.</p>

<p>It did not take long to disclose it, and at the conclusion
he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you do it, fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will we? Will a cat eat warm milk?&#8221; demanded Pete,
as if there was no question about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But say, there won&#8217;t be any come-back, will there?
We got into trouble enough with the railroad people, and
by flying our kite with Susie Mantell on the tail of it last
year, so I&#8217;m not looking for any more,&#8221; said Cap Smith solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this will be all right,&#8221; Bateye assured them. &#8220;Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll come over about eight o&#8217;clock, and make a noise like a
tree toad. Then you come out. But lock up Waggles,
your dog, or he might give the scheme away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; promised Bill, and then the boat tied up at
the wharf, and the ball players in advance of the crowd
rushed off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ll bet there&#8217;s something doing,&#8221; said Beantoe
Pudder to Spider Langdon, as they followed the throng.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the long legged lad, who was nicknamed
&#8220;Spider.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I saw those Smith Boys and Bateye talking
together, and&mdash;&#8221; but at that moment Sam Pudder stumbled
and would have fallen, had not his chum caught him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go again, Beantoe!&#8221; exclaimed Spider, as he
helped him regain his balance. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s these new shoes, I guess,&#8221; and Beantoe, who owed
his title to his habit of stumbling, limped along. &#8220;But
as I was saying, I saw the Smith fellows and Bateye and
Doc talking together. There&#8217;s something doing. Let&#8217;s
watch and see what it is,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;m with you. We&#8217;ll hang around to-night,
and maybe we can spoil their game,&#8221; and the two cronies
who, among other things in common, had a dislike for the
Smith Boys and their friends, hurried along, whispering
together.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the members of the Freeport Volunteer Fire
Department were all unaware of the plot brewing against
them.</p>

<p class="ph3">A FIRE DEPARTMENT RUN</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, boys, how did you make out at the game?&#8221;
asked Mr. Smith, as his three sturdy sons tramped into
the house a little later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; answered Pete. &#8220;It was a close game, but we
won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the father. &#8220;I wish I&#8217;d been there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Mrs. Murdock got for supper?&#8221; demanded Bill,
as he sniffed various odors coming from the kitchen.
&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s roast lamb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want sausage and potatoes!&#8221; cried Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out! It&#8217;s too early for sausage,&#8221; asserted Cap.
&#8220;Guess again, Pete.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Mrs. Murdock?&#8221; demanded Bill, as the
housekeeper just then entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roast beef and baked potatoes,&#8221; she answered, and
there was a chorus of delighted howls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried Bill a second afterward making a rush
for the buxom lady who had kept house for Mr. Smith,
since his wife&#8217;s death some years before. The other brothers,
following Bill&#8217;s lead, tried to kiss her at the same
time, but she shut herself up in the pantry for refuge,
and declared that they would not only be the cause of
making the potatoes burn, but would also spoil the roast
if they did not raise the siege. So they capitulated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
a little later were sitting down to a meal, with such appetites
as only bless those who play ball.</p>

<p>And while the meal is in progress I will take the opportunity
of introducing you to the Smith lads a little more
formally.</p>

<p>There were three of them, as you have guessed, John
the eldest, then William, or &#8220;Bill,&#8221; as he was always
called, and Pete, the youngest. They lived with their
father and the housekeeper in a large, old fashioned house
in the town of Freeport, on the Waydell river. Across
the stream was the town of Vandalia, and, as told in the
first volume of this series, entitled &#8220;Those Smith Boys,&#8221;
there was much rivalry between the two places.</p>

<p>In the initial volume it was related how the Smith boys,
who were always getting into mischief, but who did not
mean to do wrong, started off a handcar, which ran away
down grade on the new line of the Green Valley Railroad.</p>

<p>The handcar rushed through the railroad construction
camp, knocked down a water tank, crashed into the tent
of the chief surveyor, and made such a rumpus generally
that the Smith boys, fearing the consequences, ran away.</p>

<p>It was a question whether the railroad would locate
a station at Vandalia or at Freeport, and the decision was
almost in favor of Freeport when the Smith boys, played
their unfortunate trick. Then the chief surveyor determined
to place the depot in Vandalia, out of revenge.</p>

<p>The Smith brothers had many adventures during the
time they were away from home. They were looking for
a thumbless man, whom they suspected of having robbed
their father, and in their journeyings fell in with Theophilus
Clatter, a traveling vendor of patent medicines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
patent soap and a patent stain remover. They also met
with Duodecimo Donaldby, who posed as a rain-maker, or
a horse doctor, as suited his convenience.</p>

<p>The boys became traveling showmen to aid in the work
of selling the patent medicine and soap, after their friend,
Mr. Clatter, had been arrested for telling fortunes, and all
the while the lads kept a lookout for the thumbless man.</p>

<p>How they found him, and overheard him discussing a
plot to rob the paycar of the railroad, how they frustrated
his plans, saved the car and won the gratitude of the
railroad officials is told of in the book. Also how it was
decided, as a sort of a reward for what the Smith boys
had done, to locate the railroad depot in Freeport after all.
So the thoughtless prank of the lads turned out well after
all.</p>

<p>Part of the money stolen from Mr. Smith was recovered,
and the boys also received a reward from the railroad
company. Their father had planned to send them to
Westfield Academy, immediately after their return from
journeying about the country, but his financial and other
matters prevented, so the boys had spent the winter helping
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith&#8217;s business affairs were now in good shape,
and he was quite well off, so he determined that with the
opening of the fall term at Westfield, his sons should attend
there.</p>

<p>All summer the boys had been having a good time at
various sports, of which baseball was chief. They were
valued members of the Freeport nine, and it looked as
though they would do more than their share in helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that team win the pennant. Only a few more games remained
to be played before the season would be over.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then for Westfield,&#8221; remarked Pete at the supper
table that night, as they talked over their plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we can get on the nine there,&#8221; said Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure we can,&#8221; declared Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just because you can pitch well in the county
league, doesn&#8217;t say that you&#8217;ll make good at Westville,&#8221;
objected Cap. &#8220;They play big college teams there, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not afraid of a college team,&#8221; said his brother.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make the nine&mdash;you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Pete suddenly, listening
intently.</p>

<p>The sound of a tree toad came in through the opened
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bateye Jones,&#8221; murmured Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you boys going out?&#8221; asked Mr. Smith, looking
up quickly from the paper he was reading, as he heard
the name of the lads&#8217; chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&mdash;er&mdash;that is we thought of it,&#8221; replied Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I do hope you won&#8217;t get into any more mischief,&#8221;
went on their father. &#8220;I&#8217;m about tired of hearing everything
that happens in this town laid to &#8216;Those Smith
Boys.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So are we, dad!&#8221; exclaimed Cap. &#8220;And half of the
things that are done aren&#8217;t up to us at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps that&#8217;s so. But be careful now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they promised in a chorus, as they hurried out
to meet Bat-Eye. And they really meant to do as they
had said, but they were full of life and energy, and&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
you know how it is yourselves. Things don&#8217;t always turn
out as you think they will.</p>

<p>A little later six figures might have been seen hurrying
away across lots in the rear of the Smith homestead.
There had been some earnest whispering before their departure,
and from the manner in which they hastened
away it might have been argued, by anyone who knew the
lads, that something was going to happen.</p>

<p>Then, a few seconds after the six had melted away in
the darkness, two other figures rose up from the deep
grass where they had been hiding.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they go, Beantoe,&#8221; whispered one lad. &#8220;I wonder
what&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon find out, Spider,&#8221; was the response. &#8220;Come
on, we can easily follow them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cautiously the two sped on in the blackness. Just ahead
of them could be seen the group of six, and, from time to
time, the twain could hear the voices of the Smith Boys,
and their chums, Bateye Jones, Doc Lutken and Norton
Tonkin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you hear what they&#8217;re saying?&#8221; whispered Beantoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw, but we don&#8217;t need to. We&#8217;ll just follow &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>The six led their shadowers quite a chase, and it was
not until half an hour later that the foremost lad turned
into a vacant lot that stood on the outskirts of the town.
In the middle of the lot was a tumble-down barn and
shed, long disused, and useful only as an abiding place for
an occasional tramp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whizz!&#8221; exclaimed Beantoe, as he and his crony
sank down out of sight in the grass, for the six had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to a halt in front of the ancient structure. &#8220;Gee whizz!
All this round-about way, when they could have walked
down the road to this place in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; argued Spider. &#8220;That shows that
something is up. They didn&#8217;t want to be seen coming
here, and so they went around through the lots. Say, do
you know what I think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I know what I think! I think we&#8217;re chumps
for coming after them! What does it amount to, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; whispered Spider. &#8220;They have a secret
society, and they hold meetings here. That&#8217;s why
they go about it so carefully. But they can&#8217;t fool us.
We&#8217;re right here, and we&#8217;ll sneak up, hear all they say,
and then where will their secret society be, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it. Look, they&#8217;re going in the barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads who were hiding in the grass, just beyond
the fence that enclosed the old shed, raised their heads
and looked. Surely enough the Smith boys and their
friends were entering the deserted barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up and listen,&#8221; proposed Spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, wait awhile,&#8221; advised Beantoe. &#8220;Give &#8217;em a
chance to get started, and we can hear all they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re making a light!&#8221; exclaimed Spider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&#8220;Sure! Maybe they&#8217;re going to initiate new candidates
into their society. They think they&#8217;re great stuff, but
wait until they find out that we know all their secrets and
passwords. Then they&#8217;ll come down off their high
horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Come on up now. They must be started by
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carefully getting up from their hiding places the two
spies cautiously advanced toward the old barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re lighting up all over,&#8221; observed Beantoe eagerly.
&#8220;Must be going to have a regular celebration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so. Come on over on this side. There&#8217;s a
little window that we can look in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spider was leading the way, and, just as he reached
the window in question, his companion, as was his habit,
unfortunately stumbled over a stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there you go again, Beantoe!&#8221; exclaimed Spider
wrathfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I know it,&#8221; admitted his crony. &#8220;Gee horse, but it
hurts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, keep quiet and come on. I guess&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But what Spider guessed he never told, for at that moment
there was a rush of figures from the barn, and the
two spies were surrounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve caught &#8217;em!&#8221; cried Cap Smith gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got Beantoe Pudder,&#8221; announced Doc Lutken,
making a grab for the stumbling lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s Spider Langdon,&#8221; added Pete Smith, taking
a tighter hold of the struggling youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were they doing?&#8221; inquired Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Following us, of course,&#8221; said Norton Tonkin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were not!&#8221; denied Beantoe, but the evidence was
against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what they want?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have known what we were going to do, and
they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> want to squeal on us,&#8221; suggested Bateye. &#8220;What
shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it too late to stop it?&#8221; asked Bill, with a glance
toward the barn.</p>

<p>Inside could be seen several flickering lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s going hard,&#8221; answered Pete. &#8220;We can&#8217;t
put it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s make &#8217;em stand for it,&#8221; suggested Bateye.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll squeal anyhow, so let&#8217;s make &#8217;em take their share
of the blame. It won&#8217;t amount to much anyhow, for dad
was going to have the place pulled down, and he won&#8217;t
care what happens to it. We&#8217;ll tie Beantoe and Spider to
the fence here, and run and give the alarm. The firemen
will loosen &#8217;em when they get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t tie us up!&#8221; pleaded Beantoe in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t leave us here!&#8221; begged Spider. &#8220;We&#8217;ll never
say a word about your secret society. Not a word, honest
we won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said anything about a secret society?&#8221; demanded
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, ain&#8217;t that what you came out to the barn for?&#8221;
asked Beantoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you follow us to hear the secrets?&#8221; inquired
Pete, beginning to understand something.</p>

<p>Beantoe and Spider maintained a discreet silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jinks! that&#8217;s it, fellows!&#8221; cried Bill. &#8220;Say, this
is rich! Tie &#8217;em to the fence, and leave &#8217;em. Then we&#8217;ll
give the alarm! Say, this is great!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t tie us! We won&#8217;t tell!&#8221; wailed Beantoe and
Spider in a chorus.</p>

<p>But their foes were relentless, and in a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the two spies were secured to the fence across the road
from the barn. Meanwhile the flickering lights in the
old structure had increased. Smoke was pouring from
the windows and doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you can tell any story you like now,&#8221; said Pete,
as he fastened the last knot. &#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll believe you
and maybe they won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we Smith boys will be blamed anyhow,&#8221; was Bill&#8217;s
grumbling opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we might as well have the game as the name.
Come on, it&#8217;s going good now. We&#8217;ll give the department
something to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a final look at the barn, and the lads who were
tied to the fence, the Smith boys and their chums began
to run down the road in the direction of the town. As
they left, the whole interior of the rickety structure was
lighted up, and the smoke poured out thicker than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve set the barn on fire!&#8221; yelled Beantoe, as he
struggled to get loose.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re going to put the blame on us,&#8221; added
Spider, threshing about with his long legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll tell who did it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good will that do, when they find us here. Besides
those fellows will give the alarm, and that will throw
suspicion off them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look how we&#8217;re tied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, but they&#8217;ll say we did it ourselves. Oh, I
wish we hadn&#8217;t followed those Smith boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221;</p>

<p>Swiftly running down the road, the boys in question,
and their chums, set up a loud cry:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&#8220;Fire! Fire! Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were on the outskirts of the town now, and the
yell was soon taken up by many voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire! Fire! Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; demanded several.</p>

<p>&#8220;The barn on my father&#8217;s place,&#8221; answered Bateye Jones
pantingly.</p>

<p>Some one rang the alarm bell on the tower of the
hose house.</p>

<p>The few firemen on duty began to rush about, and
hitched up the horses. Other volunteers from nearby
houses hastened to the hose house. A red glare could be
seen reflected on the sky. The fire department at last
had a chance for a run, and the members rejoiced in it,
for there had been many days of inactivity. It mattered
not that the barn was a worthless structure, better burned
than left standing. It was a chance to get out the new
apparatus, and must not be missed.</p>

<p>The hose wagon and chemical engine combined rattled
out of the house. Men shouted various unimportant directions.
The horses were scarcely awake.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they go!&#8221; exulted Bateye as he and the others
prepared to race back to the scene they had so recently
left.</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose they find out we did it?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Bateye. &#8220;I got leave from
dad to burn the barn, only he didn&#8217;t know I was going to
do it to-night. He wants to put up a silo for cattle fodder
on the place, so the barn had to come down, anyhow, and
burning was the easiest way. But I thought we might
as well have some fun out of it while we&#8217;re at it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; agreed Cap Smith.</p>

<p>And then the boys, and scores of others, ran on, while
voices multiplied the cry of:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire! Fire! Fire!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A LEAKY BOAT</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old barn made a good blaze. Beantoe and Spider,
tied with their hands behind them to the fence, could not
help but admit that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, it&#8217;s a peach of a fire all right!&#8221; exclaimed the
long-legged lad, as he vainly struggled to free himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure is! I wonder if they&#8217;ll arrest us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. If they did I guess Bateye and the
others would be square enough to own up to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so, but maybe the firemen will be mad when
they find out about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out! They&#8217;ll only be too glad of a chance to
use the new hose. Besides Cooney Humpville hasn&#8217;t used
his new trumpet yet. Say, it&#8217;s getting warm all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it won&#8217;t be any hotter. It&#8217;s at the worst of
the blaze now. Why don&#8217;t the firemen come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; cried Spider.</p>

<p>From down the highway came a confused sound&mdash;shouts
and yells mingled with the galloping of horses and the
rumble of the hose wagon.</p>

<p>Up dashed the Freeport fire department, glorious in red
shirts and red helmets, with the red hose wagon in their
midst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unreel the hose!&#8221; yelled the chief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>&#8220;Better take the chemical line in first, Cooney,&#8221; suggested
one of the red shirted men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, don&#8217;t call me Cooney; call me Chief!&#8221; begged the
head of the fire-fighters. &#8220;I say put the hose on the hydrant
and squirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several men started to do this, but it was found that
the nearest fire plug was farther away than the hose would
reach, so it was unavailable for the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to take the chemical, Cooney!&#8221; called another
man. &#8220;Run the wagon nearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, don&#8217;t call me Cooney, call me&mdash;&#8221; but his men did
not stay to listen to his renewed pleading. The horses
had been unhitched, and led away. Willing hands now
dragged the wagon closer to the burning barn, and soon
two lines of small hose to carry the chemical stream were
unwound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her go!&#8221; yelled the men in a chorus, and the engineer
who operated the tanks, screwed down the wheel
valve that broke the bottle of sulphuric acid into the solution
of soda and water.</p>

<p>Two foamy streams spurted from the hose nozzles, but it
was easy to see that they would have little effect on the
blaze. A lot of water was needed, and that was not available.
Still, even though the old barn burned to the
ground no harm could result. There were no other buildings
within an eighth of a mile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; suddenly cried some of the firemen as
they neared the fence, and then they discovered Beantoe
and Spider tied to the rails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&#8220;Did you see anyone start the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get tied up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Questions were fired at the two lads, who were soon
released. They looked through the gathering throng for
a sight of the Smith boys and their chums. Beantoe saw
Bateye laughing at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are the fellows who set the barn on fire!&#8221; cried
the stumbling lad. &#8220;We saw &#8217;em; didn&#8217;t we Spider?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; and they tied us up,&#8221; and, forthwith the tale was
related to such of the firemen and the crowd as would
listen. And this was a goodly number, for it was seen that
it was useless to try to save the barn, and all that could be
done was to watch it burn, harmlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And those Smith boys tied you up?&#8221; demanded Chief
Humpville, &#8220;and burned the barn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure they did,&#8221; asserted Bateye. &#8220;Them an&#8217; Doc an&#8217;
Bateye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as likely as not these fellows set the barn, and
tied themselves up,&#8221; ventured a fireman, nodding at the
captives.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; for the Smith brothers, and Bateye ran in
and gave the alarm,&#8221; added another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you how it would be,&#8221; wailed Spider. &#8220;I
knew they&#8217;d blame us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The twain protested, even unto tears, that they had no
hand in the prank, and when they related, with much detail,
how they had been surprised and caught the tide
turned in their favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might know those Smith boys would be up to some
such game as this,&#8221; remarked Mr. Wright, who kept the
feed store. &#8220;They ought to be arrested for arson.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; or else sent away to the reform school,&#8221;
added Mr. Henderson, who sold shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear they are going away to school this fall,&#8221; declared
Mr. Flint, a retired merchant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they can&#8217;t go any too soon to suit me,&#8221; went on
Mr. Wright. &#8220;They&#8217;re always doing something&mdash;those
Smith boys are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must admit that they helped get the railroad
to come here,&#8221; suggested Mr. Blanchard, the grocer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they&#8217;re like a cow that gives a good pail of
milk and then kicks it over,&#8221; asserted Mr. Flint. &#8220;But I
ain&#8217;t going to stay here any more. The fire&#8217;s most out,
and I guess it&#8217;s a good thing the old barn went. It was
only good for tramps.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the usual feeling against the Smith boys
this was the general sentiment, and when Chief Humpville
wanted to make a charge of arson against the lads, he was
persuaded not to.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you fellows really did it; eh Bateye?&#8221; asked the
chief, when the lad who could see in the dark had admitted
his part in the affair, together with the Smith boys. They
did it to clear Beantoe and Spider, who were deemed
guilty by some.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I did it,&#8221; admitted Bateye shamelessly. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you glad you had the run?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief and his men were, but did not want to say so,
for their new helmets and red shirts had been audibly admired,
and the new apparatus, though its chemical streams
were not effective against the fire, because of the start the
blaze had acquired, were a source of pride to the townspeople.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it against the law to set a fire?&#8221; demanded the
chief, bound to maintain his dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when you have permission,&#8221; asserted Bateye, &#8220;and
my dad said I could get rid of the barn any way I liked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say you could burn it?&#8221; asked the chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly, but I liked that way better than any
other, and so we did it. I knew nothing could happen,
as there wasn&#8217;t any wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief felt the uselessness of making any comments,
especially as Mr. Jones was in the crowd, and confirmed
what his son said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I certainly didn&#8217;t know he intended to burn it at
night,&#8221; said Bateye&#8217;s father, &#8220;or I would have prevented
him. However it&#8217;s done, and I&#8217;m glad the barn is gone.
And if the firemen think&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right, Mr. Jones,&#8221; said one of the red-shirts
with a laugh. &#8220;We were getting too fat lying around.
The run did us good.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long ere the barn was but a heap of glowing
embers and then the chief, calling hoarsely through his
new trumpet, ordered the apparatus to &#8220;take up&#8221; though
there was little to take up, and the department slowly went
back to headquarters. The crowd followed, talking excitedly
of what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you fellows won&#8217;t take after us next time; will
you?&#8221; asked Cap of Beantoe and Spider, as the two lads
passed by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! You just wait; that&#8217;s all!&#8221; threatened Beantoe,
vaguely. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get square with you yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what,&#8221; added Spider, striding along on his thin
legs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to think up something mighty soon,&#8221; said
Bill, as he and his brothers and their chums turned down
a street that led to their homes. &#8220;We&#8217;re going off to school
in about three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not before the close of the ball season, though; are
you?&#8221; asked Bateye anxiously. &#8220;We can&#8217;t win the championship
if you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll finish out the season on the nine,&#8221; promised
Cap. &#8220;And I guess our team will win, if you don&#8217;t make
any more wild throws.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary a one,&#8221; promised Bateye fervidly.</p>

<p>It was several days before the town got over talking
about the fire. Mr. Smith heard of the part his sons had
taken in it, and talked severely to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you always up to such risky tricks?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;This wasn&#8217;t risky,&#8221; declared Bill in justification.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t think it was any harm,&#8221; added Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble. You don&#8217;t think enough. You
didn&#8217;t think the time you started the runaway handcar,
and you remember what happened. Now be more careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>They promised, and Mr. Smith, who was a very busy
man, sighed and wished the boys would settle down and be
less playful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe when they get to the Academy, life there will
help to settle them,&#8221; he said with a shake of his head.
Whether it did or not we shall soon see.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Beantoe and Spider were racking their brains
for some plan to get even with the Smith boys and their
friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care so much for Bateye and Doc. and Norton,&#8221;
said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> Beantoe, &#8220;but I would like to play a trick on Pete and
his brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see if I can&#8217;t think of one,&#8221; promised Spider. A
few days later he came to his crony with joy written on his
face. &#8220;I think we have them,&#8221; he said exultingly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a chance to put one over the Smith boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, and I&#8217;ll show you. They&#8217;re going out
fishing. I just saw Bill down to the hardware store buying
some hooks, and I heard him tell Bateye they were
going down past the swimming hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop at my house, get an auger and a loaf of
bread, and I&#8217;ll tell you on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the auger and bread for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you. Come on. I want to get to their boat
before they arrive. Then we&#8217;ll hide and see some fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later Beantoe and Spider stole cautiously to the
Smith boys&#8217; boat house on the banks of the Waydell river.</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep watch, and I&#8217;ll bore the holes in the boat,&#8221;
suggested Spider. &#8220;It won&#8217;t take long.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was soon busy with the auger, and then his crony
understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to make holes
in the boat, and then when they&#8217;re out fishing, it will sink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! You&#8217;re a regular detective,&#8221; said Spider, boring
away while Beantoe watched.</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t the water come in as soon as they start out,
and won&#8217;t they get on to the trick,&#8221; asked the stumbling
lad after thinking it over.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where the bread comes in,&#8221; explained his friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a lot of holes, and stuff them up with bread.
Then I&#8217;ll smear dirt over the bread and it won&#8217;t show. It
will stay in the holes until Bill and the others get out in
the middle of the river and then it will soak up, and come
out. The boat will leak like a sieve, and they&#8217;ll have to
swim ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spider worked industrially, and soon had a number of
holes in the bottom of the fishing skiff. The holes were
well plugged with bread, and smeared over so that they
did not show.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they come!&#8221; suddenly warned Beantoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m done!&#8221;</p>

<p>Spider threw away what remained of the bread, put the
auger under his coat, scattered to one side the pieces of
wood that had resulted from the boring, and then he and
his companion made a dash for the bushes, just as the
three Smith brothers came in sight, with their fishing rods
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a good day for bites,&#8221; remarked Pete, as
he got in the stern of the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed Bill, pausing on the bank to see if he had
all his tackle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in, Bill, and I&#8217;ll shove off,&#8221; proposed John, for the
boat was drawn partly up on shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now watch the fun,&#8221; whispered Spider to Beantoe, as
they peered from the bushes, and saw the boat being rowed
toward the middle of the deep river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll be drowned,&#8221; suggested Beantoe rather
frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those fellows? Naw! They can swim like fishes, but
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> clothes will get wet, and it&#8217;ll serve &#8217;em right for the
way they treated us at the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How soon before the boat will begin to leak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to in a few minutes now. Gee whillikins!
But I&#8217;m glad I thought of that trick! Won&#8217;t they be surprised
when the water comes rushing in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They sure will,&#8221; and then the two cronies eagerly
watched the Smith boys, who, all unconscious of the fate
in store for them, were rowing down toward the fishing
grounds.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A GREAT HOME RUN</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Wow</span>!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed Bill Smith, as he gave a
start that nearly upset the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, did you jab yourself?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. Ran a hook into my thumb,&#8221; answered Bill, as he
carefully extracted the barb, while Pete, who was rowing,
rested on the oars and looked critically at the few drops of
blood which oozed forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it hurt?&#8221; he asked, rather needlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it hurt? No, I do this every day just for exercise!&#8221;
retorted. Bill sarcastically as he put the injured
thumb into his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; observed Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what; jab myself? Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose I know that,
you amiable loon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I mean put your bleeding thumb into your mouth.
You are likely to get germs in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In which, my thumb or my mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, when you two fellows get through chinning, I wish
you&#8217;d pass me down the box of hooks. I want to put on a
smaller one,&#8221; observed Cap, who was getting his line ready.
As he spoke he looked down into the bottom of the boat,
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been eating crackers here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crackers? Nobody,&#8221; answered Bill. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> &#8220;Because there are a lot of cracker crumbs or bread
crumbs under the seat here, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Cap gave a sudden start, and looked toward shore.
There was a slight movement in the bushes, and Beantoe
and Spider who had been peering eagerly out, withdrew
their heads into the shrubbery.</p>

<p>&#8220;The water must be coming in now!&#8221; exulted Spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; agreed his crony.</p>

<p>Cap was anxiously staring at the bottom of the boat.
He put his finger on a certain spot. The finger nearly
went through a soft place, and a second later some water
began trickling in.</p>

<p>&#8220;By crimps! I&#8217;m on to their game!&#8221; cried Cap.
&#8220;Quick, fellows! Those cork floats from the box! Stuff
&#8217;em in the holes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What holes?&#8221; demanded Bill, removing his thumb from
his mouth that he might speak the more plainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The holes Spider and Beantoe bored, and then stuffed
up with bread,&#8221; answered Cap. &#8220;It&#8217;s an old trick. I suspected
something when I saw the crumbs. They didn&#8217;t
clean &#8217;em all up. Lively now! Cracky! Here&#8217;s another
hole. Hand over those corks, Pete, if you don&#8217;t want to
swim ashore. Quick now, and don&#8217;t let those fellows suspect.
We&#8217;ll plug the holes, and go on as if nothing had
happened. Lucky we&#8217;ve got plenty of corks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! There&#8217;s a lot of water coming in here!&#8221; called
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet!&#8221; ordered his elder brother. &#8220;Plug it up.
Don&#8217;t let on that there&#8217;s anything wrong. Beantoe and
Spider are on shore watching us. I just saw the bushes
moving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> and there&#8217;s no wind, so they must be there. Say,
are you going to be all day with those corks, Pete?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus livened up Pete passed back the box of bottle-stoppers.
By this time the bread in several holes in the
boat had become soaked through, and the water was coming
in at a lively rate. But Cap and his brothers worked fast.
They could see by the little bulges, caused by the swelling
plugs of bread, where the holes were, and, soon they had
them all stopped up before enough of the river had entered
to do any harm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now row on, Pete,&#8221; ordered Cap. &#8220;I guess we went
them one better this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, my feet are getting damp,&#8221; objected Pete, for there
was a little puddle of water under his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity about you!&#8221; sneered Cap. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for
me thinking of these corks you&#8217;d be wet all over. Row on,
now, and when we get around the bend where those fellows
can&#8217;t see us, we&#8217;ll sponge out. They&#8217;ll be wondering why
their trick didn&#8217;t work. Row on!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as Pete rowed, sending the boat along the river, it
was watched by two very much puzzled lads on the bank.
They wondered why the boat didn&#8217;t sink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I thought you said they&#8217;d have to swim ashore,&#8221;
observed Beantoe rather contemptuously to his crony.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will, in a minute. Maybe I pressed the bread
in too hard, and it takes a while to soak up. But the boat
will sink in a few seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>They resumed their watching, and, though they saw the
three brothers doing something in the boat, the hidden
ones never dreamed that the Smith boys were plugging up
the holes with corks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to sink pretty soon now, if we want to see the
fun,&#8221; observed Beantoe, after an anxious pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going down some,&#8221; said Spider doubtfully,
wondering whether he had not worked the scheme right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s going down stream, to the fishing hole,&#8221; spoke
Beantoe. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s all up with the joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>They realized that it was all over as far as they were
concerned a few minutes later, when the boat containing
the Smith boys passed around the bend and out of sight,
apparently in as good a condition as it had ever been, and
not leaking a drop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you know about that?&#8221; demanded Spider,
as he got up and stretched his cramped legs, for they had
been crouching in the bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I know about it?&#8221; demanded Beantoe in accents
of disgust. &#8220;I know that you don&#8217;t know how to
play a joke; that&#8217;s what I know. I thought we&#8217;d see some
fun, and watch those fellows have to swim ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I, but&mdash;but something went wrong, or else they
got on to the game, and stuffed up the holes,&#8221; answered
Spider, helplessly scratching his head. &#8220;Come on, I&#8217;ll treat
you to a chocolate soda.&#8221;</p>

<p>This somewhat consoled Beantoe, but there was anguish
in the hearts of the cronies when, that evening, as they
were down at the post office with the usual crowd of boys,
the Smith brothers, who had returned from a successful
fishing trip, stepped up to the plotters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something for you and Spider, Beantoe,&#8221; remarked
Cap, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded the stumbling lad, backing
away, for he feared a trick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>&#8220;Something to stop up holes in boats,&#8221; answered Cap, as
he showed a lot of corks.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of laughs for the Smith boys had
told the story, and the joke was distinctively on Beantoe
and his crony. They slunk away, and Spider had to stand
treat for several more sodas before his chum would forgive
him for being led into a plot that was so easily turned
against themselves. It was some time before they again
ventured to play a joke on our heroes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the baseball season was drawing to a close,
and the championship of the county league lay between
Vandalia and Freeport. It came to the final game, the
play-off of a tie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now fellows,&#8221; remarked Cap, one afternoon, as they
journeyed toward the diamond in Freeport, where the closing
contest was to take place, &#8220;we&#8217;ve just got to win to-day.
It means the pennant for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for Vandalia&mdash;if we lose,&#8221; added Pete, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not going to lose, Sawed-off!&#8221; exclaimed
Bill, as he swung his pitching arm around to limber it up.
&#8220;Are we, Cap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; and the tall lad thumped his big mitt.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let anything get past you to-day, Pete.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. Is Bateye going to play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but he&#8217;s improved a whole lot. My! There&#8217;s a big
crowd out!&#8221; added Cap, as he neared the grounds and saw
the great throng on the stands, and scattered about the
field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear &#8217;em yell,&#8221; remarked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Vandalia is out for blood to-day. Lucky we won
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> toss, and have the game on our grounds. It&#8217;s a good
part of the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Smith boys were soon out on the diamond with their
teammates, doing some hard practice. The crowds increased
for not only was there an intense baseball fever in
both towns, but, because of the natural rivalry between the
places, a game between Freeport and Vandalia, always
brought out a record-breaking attendance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play ball!&#8221; called the umpire, and the game was on.</p>

<p>It was a hot contest from the very beginning, when Rube
Mantell of the Vandalias knocked out a two-bagger with
the first ball Bill delivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh wow! Pretty one! Pretty one!&#8221; yelled the crowd.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a beaut! Take third! Take third!&#8221; shouted some
enthusiastic one, but the ball was fielded in too quickly.</p>

<p>There was a grim look on Cap&#8217;s face as he gave the
signal to his brother in the box, and Bill nodded. He
struck out the next man, who was a heavy hitter, gave the
following player his base on balls, and struck out the
third. The succeeding man knocked a hot liner which
Pete, at short, stopped, almost at the risk of his life, and a
goose egg went up in the first frame for Vandalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not so bad; eh?&#8221; asked Cap, as Bill came in to the
bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I nearly had heart disease when Rube whacked
it that first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, that was an accident. He can&#8217;t do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Freeport went to bat and succeeded in getting one
run over the plate, much to the joy of her supporters.
Vandalia duplicated this in her second chance, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
game ran along to the seventh inning without another run
being chalked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where we do something,&#8221; announced Jake Jensen,
of the opposing team, as he took his place, and swung
his mushroom bat menacingly. But he only fanned the
wind, as did his successor.</p>

<p>Then Flub Madison knocked as pretty a three-bagger as
was seen in many a game, and before Bateye could get the
ball in, the runner was speeding away from the last bag.
But, as he turned, Doc. Lutkin who was covering third,
limped to one side with an expression of pain on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flub has spiked Doc!&#8221; yelled Pete, running over to his
friend. The ball bounced in front of Doc, and Pete caught
it, but Flub had seen it coming, and was back on the bag.
&#8220;You spiked him on purpose!&#8221; cried Pete, drawing back
his fist.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not!&#8221; asserted Flub angrily. &#8220;He got in my way!
I couldn&#8217;t help it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you do it on purpose&mdash;you want to kill off our
men!&#8221; went on Pete menacingly, and there might have
been a row, had not Cap run down from home, and quieted
his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Flub contritely. &#8220;Are you much hurt,
Doc?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&mdash;I guess I can play,&#8221; answered the plucky lad,
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let you have a runner,&#8221; proposed the captain of
the Vandalia nine. It was the least he could do. Doc&#8217;s
foot was punctured in the fleshy part, and, after it had
been treated, the game went on. Flub came in on a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
fly by Nifty Pell, and that put the Vandalias one run ahead
whereat there was great rejoicing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do &#8217;em now or never,&#8221; declared Cap grimly,
when he and his mates came up for their turn.</p>

<p>They tried hard, but fate was against them, though Bill
was called out at first on a close decision which even the
crowd characterized as &#8220;rotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it stood, and when that inning was over the score
was two to one, in favor of Vandalia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we have one more look in, and then&mdash;&#8221; Cap
paused suggestively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that pennant going across the river,&#8221; announced
Bateye gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you never were any good at seeing things in the
daytime,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;You want to take another look,
Bateye. We&#8217;re going to win!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a positiveness in Bill&#8217;s tones that seemed to
infuse itself into the spirits of his teammates. There was
a brief consultation among the Freeport players, and exhortation
from the captain and manager, and then the final
inning began.</p>

<p>Vandalia played desperately&mdash;played for blood, and got
it&mdash;in the shape of one run, putting them two ahead. It
was due to an error of the centre fielder, who slipped when
he had a nice fly in his hands, and there was a groan of
anguish. Then the Freeport players settled grimly down,
and Bill struck out three in succession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three runs to win!&#8221; said Cap in tense tones as he
took off his mask and chest protector. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just got to
get them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pete brought in one, and after a desperate race when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
was nearly caught on third, Norton Tonkin landed another,
sliding home in a cloud of dust when the third baseman
threw the ball to the catcher, just above the latter&#8217;s head,
which error tied the score.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the winning run!&#8221; said Pete, as his elder
brother went to the bat. But the chances were against
the Freeport team getting it, as there were two out, and
the Vandalia pitcher was lasting well. Still the score
was tied and there would be another inning if Cap did not
make good.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m going to bring in a run,&#8221; he told himself
grimly, as he rubbed some dirt on his hands, and took a
firm grip of the stick.</p>

<p>The ball came whizzing toward him. He was half
minded to swing at it, but a signal he had caught passing
between the pitcher and catcher warned him, and he let
it pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike!&#8221; called the umpire. Cap opened his mouth to
say something, and then thought better of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t fool me again,&#8221; he called to the man in the
box, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whack!&#8221; That was Cap&#8217;s stick meeting the horsehide.
Out sailed the sphere, a long, low straight drive into right
field&mdash;away out among the daisies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a sweet one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, you old war-horse! Run, you scob! Run!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A homer! A homer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the way round! Come on in!&#8221;</p>

<p>These were some of the yells that greeted Cap&#8217;s performance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
But he did not stay to listen to them. On he
sped for first and rounded the initial bag with a swing that
carried him well on to second.</p>

<p>On and on he went, running as he had never run before
since he felt that on him now depended the championship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Run you lobster!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, you dear old goat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, Cap, run!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boy! Oh, a pretty one!&#8221;</p>

<p>The grandstand was rocking and swaying with the
stamping of feet. The cheers were deafening. The Vandalia
players were almost stupefied. The Freeporters were
dancing up and down in a wild delirium of joy.</p>

<p>The rightfielder was running after the ball like mad.
He had picked it up. He was throwing it in. Cap was
speeding toward third. He had passed it when the fielded
ball was in the air. Could he beat it home?</p>

<p>That was what everybody wanted to know. On and on
ran the player. Nearer and nearer came the ball. The
second baseman had it now. He threw it toward the Vandalia
catcher, who, with feet well braced apart was waiting
for it with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>Cap was almost exhausted. His legs felt like wooden
ones, but they kept going like the pistons of an engine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boy! Come on! Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you Cap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beat it! Beat it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cap dropped like a shot and slid, feet foremost. The
catcher reached forward. There was a vicious &#8220;ping!&#8221; as
the ball landed in his big mit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>There was a moment of intense anxiety. A cloud of
dust hid catcher, runner and umpire from sight.</p>

<p>And then, from this mist of dirt, in which three figures
could dimly be seen moving about, came this one word:</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, what a howling there was! What cheers, what yells,
what thumpings on the back, what improvised war-dances,
what shakings of hands!</p>

<p>For Freeport had won, almost on the last chance and
had the pennant. No wonder Cap Smith was overwhelmed
with praise as he walked panting to the bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I guess there&#8217;s something in those Smith boys
after all,&#8221; remarked Mr. Flint, who had torn his score
card to bits as he wildly whooped himself hoarse while
watching the home run.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they might be worse,&#8221; conceded Mr. Henderson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">OFF FOR WESTFIELD</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> it was because their trick of putting holes in
the Smith boys&#8217; boat did not work, or because they wanted
to get even with the brothers on general principles was
not made clear, but certain it was, that a few days after
the closing ball game, Beantoe and Spider made another
attempt to perpetrate something on our heroes.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time it will come off all right,&#8221; Spider had assured
his crony.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to; we spent time enough on it,&#8221; said the stumbling
lad. &#8220;I certainly hope it does.&#8221;</p>

<p>With much labor and secrecy the two conspirators had
made a lot of sharpened stakes, and tied stout cords to
them. They had also prepared a quantity of molasses and
lampblack.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait until they&#8217;re in their &#8216;coop,&#8217; holding a meeting,&#8221;
explained Spider. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll drive these stakes in
the ground at the foot of the stairs, so they&#8217;ll trip over the
strings when they rush down. And if they fall into the
lampblack and molasses, we can&#8217;t help it; can we?&#8221; he
chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; answered Beantoe, with a malicious
grin. &#8220;But how are you going to get them to rush out of
the coop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>&#8220;And s&#8217;pose they catch us at it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they will. It won&#8217;t take but a couple
of minutes to stick in the stakes. The ground&#8217;s soft and
the stakes are sharp. We&#8217;ll work it to-night, for it will
be good and dark, and I heard Cap tell Bateye and Doc.
to come over after supper, so they&#8217;ll all be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. We&#8217;ll get square this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later two figures, carrying some stakes and a
can, might have been seen proceeding cautiously toward the
Smith homestead. The two figures did not go boldly up
and ring the front door bell. Instead they sneaked around
in the rear where there was an old workshop, which had
been converted by Cap and his brothers into a sort of
&#8220;coop&#8221; or den, where they held meetings and talked over
pet schemes.</p>

<p>Entrance to the coop was obtained by means of an outside
stairway, which led to the second floor, where the
meetings were always held, in a room, the walls of which
were hung with bats, masks, fencing foils, boxing gloves,
fishing poles and other trophies dear to boyish hearts.</p>

<p>It was at the foot of this outside stairway, after carefully
looking about to see that they were not observed, that
Beantoe and Spider began thrusting the sharpened stakes
into the ground. Then they wound the stout cord in and
out among them, making a maze of string, which, if anyone
ran into unexpectedly in the dark, would be very likely
to trip him up.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now to spread the molasses and lampblack
around and give the alarm,&#8221; said Spider, when they had
nearly finished their preparations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure they&#8217;re up there?&#8221; asked Beantoe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>&#8220;Pretty sure. You can see the light, and I heard a lot
of voices.&#8221;</p>

<p>They listened a moment and caught the unmistakable
tones of Cap Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; whispered Spider. &#8220;Pour the stuff out,
Beantoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, I don&#8217;t wanter. You&#8217;d better,&#8221; objected the tripping
youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not! Didn&#8217;t I get all the stuff, and stick in
most of the stakes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I sharpened some. Besides, I&#8217;m afraid if I pour
it I might slip and fall into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, I didn&#8217;t think of that,&#8221; and as Spider recalled
the unfortunate habit of his crony he took the can
of molasses and lampblack from him, and began making a
trail of it all about the foot of the stairs, walking backwards
so as to keep out of it himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that will do,&#8221; announced the long-legged lad
at length. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll hide back here and watch the fun.
I&#8217;ll bring &#8217;em out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, and you&#8217;ll hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spider drew from his pocket a blank cartridge pistol.
Looking as well as he could in the dark, to observe that
his companion was hidden, Spider fired two shots in the
air, and immediately gave a very good imitation of a dog&#8217;s
agonized howling.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s their dog, Waggles,&#8221; whispered Spider,
&#8220;and they&#8217;ll come out quickly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>His surmise was correct. The door of the coop, at the
head of the outside stairway was suddenly thrown open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and in the glare of light could be seen Cap Smith standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; the hidden ones could hear those in the
coop asking. &#8220;Is Waggles shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be Waggles&mdash;he&#8217;s here,&#8221; answered Cap. &#8220;Come
back!&#8221; he ordered as the dog, with a whine, started down the
stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was some dog,&#8221; insisted Pete, coming to the
door, and joining his brother as he peered out into the
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it was&mdash;and two shots. I&#8217;m going down to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come too,&#8221; volunteered Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I&#8217;d get &#8217;em out,&#8221; whispered Spider, and
Beantoe grunted.</p>

<p>Cap started down the stairs, followed by Pete. Bill
together with Doc. and Bateye came after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now watch carefully!&#8221; whispered Spider, trying not to
laugh.</p>

<p>Suddenly Cap uttered an exclamation. He had run
into the first string. He swung about, got tangled in
another and went down, for his feet slipped in the molasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Look out, fellows, there&#8217;s
something wrong here! Keep back!&#8221;</p>

<p>But his warning came too late. Pete made a jump to
help his brother, and he too went down, sprawling in the
sticky stuff.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s glue!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Show a light!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a light,&#8221; repeated Sawed-off, as he floundered about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep back!&#8221; yelled Cap.</p>

<p>There was so much confusion that Bill, Doc, and Bateye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
came down to see what the trouble was. Then, they too,
got tangled in the cords, and went ingloriously down, the
sticky and black stuff getting all over their clothes, hands
and faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh wow! This is awful!&#8221; panted Cap, as he crawled
out, and being now able to dimly make out the cords and
stakes he could avoid them. &#8220;It&#8217;s a trick!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time for us to skip,&#8221; murmured Spider who was doubled
up with laughter. &#8220;I guess this one works all right;
didn&#8217;t it Beantoe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure did. But come on, or they&#8217;ll catch us.&#8221;</p>

<p>They started to crawl away. Cap staggered up the
stairs and got a lantern. He came down, and by the light
he saw what sorry looking objects were his brothers and
chums.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is fierce!&#8221; he wailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a peach!&#8221; cried Pete. &#8220;Look at him, Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re <i>all</i> covered with the stuff!&#8221; exclaimed Bateye,
who looked like an amateur minstrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; whispered Cap.</p>

<p>The sound of some one stumbling in the bushes came to
the ears of the brothers. It was the unfortunate companion
of Spider, falling down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beantoe Pudder!&#8221; cried Cap. &#8220;He and Spider did
this!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a dash in the direction of the sound. Beantoe
got up and tried to run, but went down again, dragging
Spider with him, for the latter&#8217;s long legs got tangled up in
a garden rake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried Cap to his brothers after a rush as
he stood over the conspirators. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got &#8217;em both!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>They tried to arise, but Cap pushed Beantoe back, and
grabbed Spider. He knew it would take the stumbling
lad some time to get up, and before he could do so, Pete
was on hand, and had made a prisoner of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of &#8217;em!&#8221; exulted Bill, who came up on the run.
&#8220;What shall we do with &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em a dose of their same medicine,&#8221; decided Cap
grimly. And it was done.</p>

<p>When the unfortunate Beantoe and Spider were released
from the hands of their enemies they were even
sorrier looking objects than were the Smith boys and their
chums. For the work of rolling the conspirators in the
lampblack and molasses had been thoroughly done, whereas
our friends only had some scattered spots on themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let us go!&#8221; begged Beantoe, &#8220;we&#8217;ll never do anything
to you again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, please let us go, and we&#8217;ll always be your friends
forever,&#8221; promised Spider eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much you won&#8217;t be our friends!&#8221; declared Cap.
&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t let you be friends even with our dog, Waggles.
Now, fellows, into the ditch with them, and I guess
that will end it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8221; wailed Spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t!&#8221; begged Beantoe. But no heed was paid
to their protests, and into the ditch at the end of the garden
they were thrown, from whence they clambered, dripping
with slime, and very much chastened in spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they certainly did put one over us,&#8221; admitted Bill,
a little later, as he and his brothers and chums were cleaning
themselves off as best they could.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, and even though we got back at them, it won&#8217;t
take the molasses out of our clothes,&#8221; said Pete ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe Mrs. Murdock won&#8217;t make a fuss!&#8221; observed
Bill uneasily, and the housekeeper did, even to the extent
of complaining to Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, this practical joke business has got to stop,&#8221;
said their father, when he heard the story next morning.
&#8220;Spoiling your clothes is too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dad,&#8221; objected Cap, &#8220;it was Beantoe and Spider
who worked it on us. We didn&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they wouldn&#8217;t have done it if you hadn&#8217;t done
something to them first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; protested Bill, &#8220;they were mad because the boat
trick didn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they tried that scheme on you because of what you
did to them at the fire,&#8221; remarked Mr. Smith. &#8220;No, boys,
it must stop; and to make sure of it, I&#8217;m going to send you
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send us away?&#8221; faltered Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s the only means by which I can have any
peace. I know you don&#8217;t mean any harm, but I never
know what is going to happen next. I have arranged for
you to go away to boarding school&mdash;the Westfield Academy,
as you know. The term does not open in two weeks, but I
can&#8217;t stand this any longer. Mrs. Murdock, help the boys
to pack up. I&#8217;m going to send them to school at once, and
have them out of the way. I have been thinking of this,
and I wrote to Dr. Burton, president of Westfield, asking
if they could come. He said they might, so get ready to go,
boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith tried to speak severely, but there was a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
smile on his lips. The boys said nothing for a few seconds.
Then Cap softly cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Westfield!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I haven&#8217;t quite made the punishment fit the
crime,&#8221; said Mr. Smith softly, as he turned away. &#8220;But
off you go, boys. You&#8217;ll start to-morrow, and I hope you
will like it. You may be a bit lonesome at first, but it will
give you a chance to get acquainted with the school and
grounds before the other students arrive. Now I&#8217;ll have a
little quietness,&#8221; and Mr. Smith went to his library, while
the boys executed a noiseless war dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, those boys! Those boys!&#8221; exclaimed the housekeeper
throwing up her hands hopelessly.</p>

<p>How they managed to get ready on such short notice the
brothers hardly knew, but they accomplished it, and the
next afternoon, having bidden their friends good-bye, they
took the train for Westfield Academy, an institution of
learning about one hundred miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now remember,&#8221; called Mr. Smith after them, &#8220;no more
practical jokes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; promised Cap. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to play
baseball as soon as the spring season opens.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A LIVELY HAZING</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Wow</span>! But this is a lonesome place!&#8221; exclaimed Cap
Smith, as he and his brothers were set down by the depot
stage in front of the gates of Westfield Academy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ve got it all to ourselves for two weeks,&#8221; added
Pete. &#8220;I wonder how we can stand it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got to,&#8221; declared Bill grimly. &#8220;Say, they&#8217;ve got a beaut
diamond,&#8221; and he motioned toward the baseball field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing in that line until spring,&#8221; commented
Cap. &#8220;Football has the call now, but I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose we&#8217;ll
get a look in at that. Well, come on,&#8221; and he went
through the massive bronze gates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you going?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to see Prexy. Dad gave me a letter for Dr. Burton,
the president, and we want to pay our respects, and
find out where we&#8217;re going to sleep to-night. I don&#8217;t exactly
feel like camping out on the grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me either,&#8221; came from Pete. &#8220;Say, as soon as we can
get into some old togs can&#8217;t we get up a game. Maybe
there are some fellows sent on here early, like us, and we
can pick up a nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not, son,&#8221; spoke John, &#8220;but that looks like
a place where a college president would hang out. Come
on, we&#8217;ll give it a trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later they were shaking hands with the venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Dr. Burton, who made them genially welcome, but
looked all the while as if he didn&#8217;t quite know what to do
with them, and wished they would take themselves off, or
go away so that he could get back to a volume of Chinese
proverbs on which he was working, making a translation
of it into modern Hebrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to see you young gentlemen,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I hope you will like it here at Westfield. The students
will&mdash;ahem&mdash;arrive shortly.&#8221; That was all the reference
he made to the fact that our heroes were sent on
ahead of the time as a sort of punishment, and the boys
were duly grateful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have arranged for you to have rooms, temporarily, in
the senior dormitory,&#8221; went on Dr. Burton. &#8220;Professor
Landmore, the science instructor is there, and he&mdash;er&mdash;he
will, ahem&mdash;look after you,&#8221; and the good doctor seemed a
trifle embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he thinks we sure do need looking after,&#8221; murmured
Pete, when he and his brothers had settled down in
a big room containing three beds, which apartment was to
be their home until the term opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we decorate?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, put up all our trophies? Not much!&#8221; exclaimed
Pete. &#8220;Wait until we get into our own flat, and see what
sort of neighbors we have. This will do for now. I&#8217;m going
to get unharnessed,&#8221; and he proceeded to don some
more comfortable clothes than those in which he had traveled.</p>

<p>A little later the brothers were out on the deserted diamond,
tossing balls back and forth, and batting them. In
vain they looked for some one with whom to organize even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
half a nine, and finally they gave it up, and strolled about,
looking at the college buildings, walking over the football
gridiron, and speculating as to what sort of fellows they
would get chummy with when the students arrived.</p>

<p>For two weeks our heroes lived rather a dull life, though
Professor Landmore made friends with them, and took
them on long walks collecting science specimens. Once he
went fishing with them, but he paid little attention to the
sport after he had captured a new species of frog, notes
concerning which he proceeded to enter at great length in a
book, while the Smith boys pulled out some fine specimens
of the finny tribe.</p>

<p>That night, the final one before the opening of the term,
our friends were given their regular rooms in the Freshman
dormitory&mdash;three connecting apartments, not very large,
but just suitable for the boys. And straightway the
brothers began to decorate the walls, each in his own peculiar
way.</p>

<p>With their choice possessions and trophies hung up, the
brothers gathered in Pete&#8217;s room that night for a talk before
turning in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the crowd will be here to-morrow,&#8221; observed Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and then for some lively times,&#8221; added Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Initiations, and hazing and all that. But we&#8217;ll have
to stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know,&#8221; declared Cap. &#8220;We all want
to make the ball team this spring, and if we balk out of the
hazing I know what that means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to take all that comes?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, up to a certain point, but if it gets too strenuous,
I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> take a hand myself. But we can&#8217;t tell until the time
comes. Now let&#8217;s get to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lively were the scenes that took place the next day.
With the arrival of many new students, the return of old
ones, the assigning of the boys to their rooms, the making
up of classes, it is a wonder that poor old &#8220;Prexy&#8217;&#8221; did
not desert. But he took everything calmly, and soon a sort
of order came out of chaos.</p>

<p>The Smith boys found themselves in the midst of a
lively colony of students in their dormitory. There were
five rooms on a short corridor, and of these our heroes had
three. Pete&#8217;s apartment was between those of Bill and
John&#8217;s, while the letter&#8217;s adjoined the room of Donald Anderson,
a new lad who was at once dubbed &#8220;Whistle-Breeches&#8221;
by some senior from the fact that Donald wore
corduroy trousers, which squeaked or &#8220;whistled&#8221; as he
walked. As soon as he learned why he was so christened,
he got rid of the offending garments, but the name stuck,
and &#8220;Whistle-Breeches&#8221; he remained to the end of his
course.</p>

<p>Next to Bill there roomed a well-dressed, supercilious
lad, who was reputed to be quite wealthy, and his overbearing
manners added to this surmise. He was James
Guilder, but he was at once christened &#8220;Bondy&#8221; for he had
boasted of his father&#8217;s stocks and bonds.</p>

<p>Behold then, these five lads domiciled together in the
Freshman corridor. Across the hall from Pete&#8217;s room, was
a larger apartment, which, as befitted his station, held a
lordly senior, one Dick Lawson, who rejoiced in the name
of &#8220;Roundy&#8221; because he was fat. He was also good natured,
and though the school authorities had placed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
there to have a sort of leavening effect on the Freshmen,
he was too good natured to be any sort of a monitor.</p>

<p>After the first supper, partaken of with the entire school
assembled in the refectory, the three Smith boys went to
their rooms, not knowing what else to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, we&#8217;re not going to stay in like chickens; are
we?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but take it easy,&#8221; advised Cap. &#8220;We want to get
the lay of things before we start anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; agreed Pete. &#8220;Do you know what
the Freshmen do the first night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get hazed?&#8221; ventured Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they go out and collect signs from around town&mdash;pull
&#8217;em off, you know; bootblack signs, restaurant signs&mdash;any
kind&mdash;and decorate their rooms with &#8217;em. Let&#8217;s do it.
Whistle-Breeches said he&#8217;d go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s don&#8217;t,&#8221; came from Cap calmly. &#8220;To-morrow will
do as well, and I want to look over some lessons. We&#8217;ve
got to buckle down to work here. It isn&#8217;t like the school
at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! I say you&#8217;re not going to become a greasy grind
so soon; are you?&#8221; demanded Bill in contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; answered Cap, &#8220;but we didn&#8217;t come here
just to have fun. Dad expects something of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed Pete, &#8220;and we won&#8217;t disappoint him,
either. I guess I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But a knock on the door interrupted him, and a voice
called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Open up, Freshies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hazers!&#8221; whispered Bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> &#8220;Shall we stand &#8217;em
off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might as well get it over with,&#8221; suggested Cap. &#8220;Just
stick together, that&#8217;s all, and when I give the word, which
I&#8217;ll do if they get too strenuous, just sail into &#8217;em as we
did into Beantoe and Spider that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed his brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Freshies! Open up or we&#8217;ll break in!&#8221; and
the summons was a thundering one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming!&#8221; cried Pete gaily, and he swung back the portal
to confront a crowd of Sophs and Juniors, who had
taken it unto themselves to do some hazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is fruit! This is easy!&#8221; was the cry, as they
saw the Smith brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;please you&mdash;you won&#8217;t be too&mdash;too rough, will
you fellows?&#8221; pleaded Pete, in simulated terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rough? Oh no, we&#8217;ll be as gentle as lambs; eh boys?&#8221;
retorted one of the hazers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, we won&#8217;t do a thing to them!&#8221; cried another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s in the next room?&#8221; demanded the leader of the
band.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bondy Guilder,&#8221; replied Bill, indicating the room adjoining
his, where the wealthy lad was domiciled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And on the other side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whistle-Breeches Anderson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Yank &#8217;em both out, boys,&#8221; was the order, and
some of the cohorts left to execute it, while our three
heroes were pulled and hauled from their apartments, going
not unwillingly, as they thought of Cap&#8217;s plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out on the diamond with them,&#8221; ordered the leader,
who was addressed as &#8220;Senator&#8221; but with whom the Smith
boys were not acquainted. &#8220;Bring along the other two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pete and his brothers soon found themselves in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of a motley crowd of Freshmen, more or less alarmed over
the ordeal in prospect. Some were cravenly begging to be
let off. Others were threatening and some, like our friends,
were silent, taking it as a matter of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, the gauntlet for some one,&#8221; ordered the Senator.
&#8220;Line up, fellows. Here&#8217;s a good one to start with,&#8221;
and he hauled Bondy Guilder out from the press.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hands off!&#8221; exclaimed the wealthy lad angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho! High and Mighty; eh? Well, that doesn&#8217;t
go at Westfield. Send him down the line, fellows,&#8221; and
the Senator gave Bondy a shove. The hazers had lined up
in two files, armed with bladders, rolls of papers, books
and stockings filled with flour. It was a reproduction of
the old Indian gauntlet along which hapless prisoners had
to pass, being beaten and clubbed as they ran.</p>

<p>&#8220;You chaps are doing this at your own risk!&#8221; cried
Bondy trying to break away.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, sport! We&#8217;ll chance it,&#8221; came the
answer. &#8220;Run, you lobster, or you&#8217;ll get the worst of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I protest!&#8221; cried the victim, as he turned to see who
had hit him with an inflated bladder, in which corn rattled.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doth protest too much!&#8221; cried a laughing hazer,
fetching Bondy a resounding thump with a slap-stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run!&#8221; shouted the Senator, giving him another shove,
and the wealthy lad ran perforce, since he was half-pushed,
half-pulled the length of the double line.</p>

<p>And what a trouncing he got! He was at once recognized
as a supercilious and overbearing lad and the punishment
to fit the crime was duly meted out to him. He
reached the end of the gauntlet rather much the worse for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
wear, and his spruce new suit was in need of a tailor&#8217;s
services.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the next!&#8221; cried the Senator. &#8220;Where&#8217;s that
Whistle-Breeches fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; answered Anderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll let you off easy, for you look like a good
sort.&#8221; Whistle-Breeches was grinning in an agony of apprehension.
&#8220;Can you sing?&#8221; he was asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A&mdash;a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, then you&#8217;ll do the Highland fling. Here, who&#8217;s
got the mouth organ?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; was the answer from the ranks of the hazers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pipe up a Scotch hornpipe. Where&#8217;s that whitewash
brush, and skirt. Off with his trousers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Donald could protest he was minus his lower
garments and a short skirt of Scotch plaid had been slipped
over his head, and fastened behind. Then a dangling whitewash
brush was hung about his hips, in imitation of a
Scottish costume, and while the mouth organ made doleful
music Whistle-Breeches as well as he was able, which was
not very good, did a dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Livelier!&#8221; was the command, amid a gale of laughter,
and livelier it was, until even the hazers were satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next,&#8221; called the Senator, like a barber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are three we can work off together,&#8221; volunteered
some one, and Pete, Bill and John Smith were thrust
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll it be?&#8221; demanded the Senator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blanket tossing,&#8221; called several.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>&#8220;No, the pond test.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too cold for the water. We&#8217;ll give &#8217;em the blanket
degree. Bring out the woolens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some heavy horse blankets were produced and with the
hazers holding to the corners, our heroes were tossed up
into the air, and caught as they came down with sickenish
feelings. But they had been through the ordeal before,
and knew what to do. They kept quiet and were not hurt.</p>

<p>But when Bill and Pete were tossed together, it was not
so much fun, and they very nearly had an accident. Altogether
it was rather a tame hazing, and the Sophs and
Juniors felt it so.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pond! The pond!&#8221; was the cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means a ducking,&#8221; said Cap in a whisper to his
brothers. &#8220;We won&#8217;t stand for that. Let &#8217;em take you
along easy, until they get you right to the edge, and then
take a brace, and pitch in the first man you can grab. I&#8217;ll
whistle when it&#8217;s time. They won&#8217;t suspect anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The pond! The pond!&#8221; was the cry again raised, and
though the Senator and some of the older students were a
bit averse to it they had to give in to the majority.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried the crowd, hustling Pete and the two
other lads along. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be over in a minute and you&#8217;ll
feel better for it,&#8221; consoled one hazer to Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think so?&#8221; he asked gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; was the reply, and the youth wondered why the
three did not make more of a fuss. He found out a little
later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much against our will, we are compelled to initiate you
into the mysteries of the Knights of the Frogs,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Senator, as the crowd lined up on the bank of a pond not
far from the football gridiron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said Cap easily, glancing on either side
where his brothers stood. &#8220;Is it deep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only to your waist,&#8221; answered the Senator. &#8220;Can you
swim?&#8221; and he was in earnest for he would have stopped
the hazing had he found either of the candidates deficient
in the watery pastime.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; admitted Bill. &#8220;Oh, please&mdash;please don&#8217;t
throw us in!&#8221; he pleaded suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t&mdash;I&mdash;I have a cold,&#8221; added Pete, taking his
cue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;d a good deal rather have something else, if it&#8217;s
all the same to you,&#8221; put in Cap, pretending to shiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought we&#8217;d get their goat!&#8221; shouted a lad who had
been disappointed that the candidates did not show more
fear. &#8220;All ready now, in with &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three Smith brothers allowed themselves to be led
close to the edge of the pond. On either side of each lad
stood a hazer, with one hand on a collar and the other
grasping the seat of the trousers.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready!&#8221; again called the leader. &#8220;I&#8217;ll count three
and in they go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One!&#8221; came the tally, and the throwers swayed their
victims slowly to and fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two!&#8221; came the count.</p>

<p>But before the third signal could be given there came
a whistle from Cap. At that instant the hazers had eased
back ready for the forward motion at the word three!</p>

<p>But it did not come. Instead Pete, Cap and Bill seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to slip down. In an instant they were loose. But they did
not run.</p>

<p>Instead they put out their feet, one after the other gave
vigorous shoves, and six forms, dextrously tripped, lay
prostrate on the sod. They were the forms of the lads
who had expected to toss into the pond the three Freshmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;In with &#8217;em!&#8221; cried Cap, and before the astonished
hazers knew what was up, one after the other had been
rolled down the sloping bank of the pond, into the water.</p>

<p>The tables had been turned most effectively, and, as our
heroes fled off through the night they heard some one call:</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of tripe, what are we up against? Who
were those fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Th&mdash;those&mdash;those Smith boys!&#8221; was the spluttering
answer of one who crawled out of the frog pond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">MOVING THE SENIOR STONE</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">It</span> occurs to me,&#8221; remarked Cap Smith one evening
about a week after the hazing, when his two brothers and
Whistle-Breeches had foregathered in the elder Smith lad&#8217;s
room for a talk, &#8220;it occurs to me, fellows, that we&#8217;re not
doing much to uphold the honor and dignity of the Freshman
class. What about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not doing much?&#8221; demanded Bill. &#8220;Say, didn&#8217;t we
put it all over the fellows who tried to haze us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for the time being, but they caught us later, and
man-handled us about twice as badly as if we&#8217;d let them
carry out the original program,&#8221; answered Cap musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, didn&#8217;t we win the cane rush, and can&#8217;t we carry
our sticks?&#8221; asked Pete as he mended a broken bat in
anticipation of spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Cap, &#8220;we did win the rush, and we
ought to have, for the Freshman class is big this term.
That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m complaining of, it&#8217;s so big, and there
are such a lot of fine fellows in it&mdash;not to mention ourselves&mdash;that
it ought to do something to make its name
known and feared for generations to come in the annals
of Westfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning just what?&#8221; asked Whistle-Breeches, as he
carefully marked a page in his algebra, lest he forget it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>&#8220;Meaning that we ought to get busy. Now have you
fellows anything to propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might paint the class numerals on the bell tower.
That hasn&#8217;t been done in a couple of years I understand,&#8221;
spoke Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Childish,&#8221; was Cap&#8217;s objection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go about town, changing all the signs in front of
the stores,&#8221; came from Pete. &#8220;The Freshmen did that one
year, and a chap with a pair of shoes to fix took them
into a millinery joint. That would be sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Regular high-school game,&#8221; was what Cap said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s old. Think of something new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, it isn&#8217;t altogether safe,&#8221; added Whistle-Breeches.
&#8220;I tried to get some signs for my room the
other day, and I did get a nice one from a ladies&#8217; hair
dressing parlor, but the proprietor turned out to be a man,
and he spotted me. It cost me just seven-fifty for that
sign. I could have had one made for a dollar. I&#8217;m not
stuck on the sign racket. But, Cap, how about taking
down the Junior flag pole? We could dig it up some dark
night and shift it over to the football field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be so bad,&#8221; remarked Cap condescendingly.
&#8220;But I have what I think is a better plan. You
know that big meteor, or piece of a meteor, that stands
just off the middle of the main campus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Senior stone?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. Now what&#8217;s the matter with taking that and
depositing it on the college front steps some dark night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, move the Senior stone?&#8221; cried Whistle-Breeches
aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; answered Cap, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t chained down; is it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>&#8220;No, but it weighs several tons,&#8221; declared Bill, &#8220;and
besides it is almost sacred. Why, it&#8217;s a piece of a meteor
that some polar discoverer brought back and presented to
the school. The Seniors have always claimed it, and that&#8217;s
where they hold their farewell doings every commencement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Cap. &#8220;All the more reason for moving
it. The meteor must be tired of staying so long in one
place. Besides we owe the Seniors something, for the way
they turned in and helped the Juniors haze us this term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;move the Senior stone!&#8221; gasped Pete, as if it was
a crime unheard of.</p>

<p>The Senior&#8217;s stone at Westfield was an ancient and honorable
institution. I forgot how many years it had occupied
a spot on the campus, and, as Bill said, the graduates
always gathered about it at Commencement and had &#8220;doings&#8221;
there. The stone, which was of meteoric origin, was
very heavy, and was considered almost sacred to the upper
class. Freshmen were required by school tradition to take
off their hats when passing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what do you say to it?&#8221; asked Cap, when the idea
had sufficiently filtered through the minds of his brothers
and their visitor. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be worth doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could manage it,&#8221; answered Pete. &#8220;But it&#8217;s infernally
heavy, and how could we shift it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; answered Cap. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it all worked out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would take half the class to carry it,&#8221; went on Bill,
&#8220;and if we get a crowd like that out on the campus at
night the faculty would be on in a minute, to say nothing
of the Seniors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend that half the Freshman class, or even
ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> members of it shall have a part in it,&#8221; went on Cap.
&#8220;We four are enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, to move that big stone?&#8221; cried Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; exclaimed his elder brother. &#8220;Do you want to
give the scheme away? Not so loud. Evidently you
haven&#8217;t studied physics lately; and the principles of the
wedge, lever, pulleys and the like are lost on you. I have
the very machine needed to move the stone, and if you
fellows will help we can do it to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll help!&#8221; said Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t done much lately,&#8221; added Whistle-Breeches.
&#8220;I&#8217;m with you. But why to-night? It&#8217;s late now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better. We can get out without any one
seeing us. Besides the Seniors are having a class meeting
to-night and they won&#8217;t spot us. If you&#8217;re ready come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others hesitated a moment, and then prepared to
follow Cap. That leader, having ascertained by a careful
observation that the coast was clear below, let himself out
into the corridor, went down it a short distance to see that
no scouting monitor was on the alert, and then signalled
to his brothers and Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>A little later four shadowy forms, skirting along in the
darkness made their way softly out of the school grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Bill, as Cap led them
along a road which was dug up for the putting in of a
sewer and water system. &#8220;This is as bad as crossing the
Alps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, beyond the Alps lies Italy, and beyond these dirt
piles is the machine we need for moving the Senior stone,
my lads,&#8221; was Cap&#8217;s whispered answer. &#8220;Come on, we
are almost there.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>They proceeded in silence until there came a sudden cry
of dismay from Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; inquired Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I stumbled in a hole! Say, it&#8217;s as dark as red ink,
and full of gullies along here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as bad as Beantoe,&#8221; declared Pete. &#8220;Come on.
How much farther, Cap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s around here somewhere I think. I spotted it
to-day as I was coming from town, and that&#8217;s how I happened
to think of the scheme. Ah, here it is,&#8221; and in the
semi-darkness he went over to something that looked like
half of a wagon truck. It consisted of two high wheels,
with an iron arrangement between them, a long pole or
lever and several chains.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, for the love of tripe?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Cap, &#8220;is a stone-carrier, a pipe-carrier, a
stump-puller and is also used in a variety of other ways
to lift heavy weights and transport them from one place to
another. The technical name has escaped me, but I think
that will answer you,&#8221; and with this delivered in his best
class room style, Cap took hold of the long pole and began
moving the machine out from amid a pile of sewer and
water pipes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I believe that <i>will</i> do the trick!&#8221; exclaimed Bill
admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it will,&#8221; declared Cap. &#8220;Come on, now. We
haven&#8217;t any too much time, for the Seniors may come out
of meeting any minute, and some may take a notion to
stroll around the campus, though it&#8217;s not likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Behold the conspirators then, a little later, trundling the
big two-wheeled affair along the dark road. Fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the dirt was thick, and the machine made no noise.
Also the campus grass was long and soft and the wheels
rolled smoothly along.</p>

<p>A careful bit of scout-work on the part of Bill, a cautious
approach and soon the plotters were beside the meteor
ready to fasten the chains around it, lift the heavy weight
by the enormous leverage of the long handle, and wheel it
to the main school steps.</p>

<p>Cap and Bill adjusted the chains, handling them with
care, so that they would not rattle. The links were soon
fastened about the stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready now?&#8221; asked Cap in a whisper, as he took
his place at the lever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her go,&#8221; answered Pete.</p>

<p>Cap and his two brothers bore down on the handle.
Something began to give. Suddenly there was a hoarsely
whispered appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! For cats&#8217; sake! You&#8217;ve got my foot caught in
the chains! You&#8217;re lifting me with the rock!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the unfortunate Whistle-Breeches who had been
stationed near the meteor to steady it when it was raised
from its ancient bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up, get loose!&#8221; commanded Cap, and he and the
others raised the pole until the chains were slackened sufficiently
for Donald to get his foot out.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, go ahead!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>There was a creaking of wood and metal. The big lever
came slowly down. More slowly Whistle-Breeches saw the
meteor being raised. At last it was free from the ground,
and was slung, in the chains, between the two big wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;She&#8217;s free!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>&#8220;Come on then,&#8221; ordered Cap, and they started across
the campus, pulling after them the Senior stone, which
from the time when the mind of man ran not to the contrary,
had reposed in a place of honor. Now it was moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right in the middle of the steps,&#8221; suggested Cap, and
they bent their course in that direction. A little later
the heavy stone, weighing several tons, was carefully lowered
on the big paving flag that marked the beginning of
the main school entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather guess they&#8217;ll open their eyes when they see
that,&#8221; said Cap, as he wheeled the machine away, and
stood off to observe the effect. Truly the meteor rested in
a strange place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on&mdash;no time for artistic observation,&#8221; suggested
Bill. &#8220;We may get caught. Let&#8217;s make a get-away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed Whistle-Breeches, and silently through
the darkness they sped with the wheeled affair.</p>

<p>As they were leaving the college grounds they heard
some one approaching along the road which they must
take to return the lifter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one&#8217;s coming! Duck!&#8221; whispered Cap hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And leave this?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Shove it into the bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>They tried to carry out this plan, but, even as they
were doing so some one came into sight. There was just
light enough to see that the man was Professor Landmore
of the science class, and at the sight of him the four lads,
abandoning the machine, made a headlong dive for the
bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; demanded the professor, suddenly
halting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>No answer, of course; only the sound of hurried flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand to know if you are Westfield lads!&#8221; went on
the instructor vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think he recognized us?&#8221; asked Bill, as they paused
for breath, for they were now well hidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered Cap, peering through the
bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone to look at the two wheels,&#8221; reported Bill,
who was also making an observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re safe,&#8221; decided Cap. &#8220;He&#8217;ll make a book
of notes about it, and calculate how much more weight it
could lift if it had bigger wheels, and a lever twice as long.
Come on, we&#8217;ll get back to our little beds,&#8221; and he started
away as stealthily as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t he see the machine, and know how the stone
was moved?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it? We can&#8217;t help it, and even a member of
the Senior class in differential calculus and strength of material
will know that meteor couldn&#8217;t move of itself. As
long as Prof. didn&#8217;t see us I don&#8217;t care. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, before they made their silent ways into their rooms
that night, the four conspirators took another look at the
big stone of Senior fame, resting in its unaccustomed place.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a row in the morning,&#8221; was Cap&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p class="ph3">ORGANIZING THE NINE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nobody</span> was late for chapel next day&mdash;a most unusual
occurrence. But the news of the removal of the stone
had early become known, and before the first call for
breakfast almost the entire school was out on the campus,
gazing at the work of the Smith boys and Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that was a peach of a stunt all right,&#8221; was the
general comment. &#8220;Who did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if we find out who of you Freshies did it, there&#8217;ll
be something <i>else</i> doing,&#8221; was the angry retort of the
Seniors, since, just before leaving the stone, Cap had
painted on it in hastily scrawled characters:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;COMPLIMENTS OF THE FRESHMEN.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish you knew?&#8221; demanded Pete, with a
wink at his brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do if you did know?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make you fellows roll it back with your noses,&#8221; was the
grim answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the mischief did they do it?&#8221; some of the
cooler-headed Seniors wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the little beggars must have used a platform, on
long poles to carry it on,&#8221; decided one of the upper class.
&#8220;Though how they got away with it, and so quietly, is a
mystery. How are we going to get it back?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>&#8220;Have to hire a gang of men I guess,&#8221; said a companion
dubiously.</p>

<p>The matter was spoken of by Dr. Burton at the morning
exercises, and he requested whoever had perpetrated
the &#8220;alleged joke,&#8221; as he called it, to make himself, or
themselves, known. Of course no one confessed, nor did
the good doctor expect them to, but he had done his duty,
and then he hurried back to his study to resume work on
translating some clay tablets, of early Assyrian characters,
a friend had sent him.</p>

<p>It was Professor Landmore who solved the problem, by
telling his class that day of a curious machine he had seen
for applying the principle of the lever, and he described the
big two wheeled affair he had noticed beside the road the
previous evening. Then the secret was out, and the Seniors
learned how the trick had been worked. It was even
rumored that the Smith boys had had a hand in it, but
nothing came of it, and the upper classmen had to endure
the taunts and stings of the Freshmen until, by hiring
some of the sewer contractor&#8217;s men, the stone was put back
in its old place.</p>

<p>But the joke created quite a stir, and our heroes were
considered &#8220;honor men&#8221; in the Freshman class, which had
gained undying fame by so simple a means, for it was
many years before the story of the removal of the Senior
stone grew stale in the annals of Westfield.</p>

<p>But now matters were more or less settled down in the
school, and our three friends gave at least part of their
time to study. Meanwhile they had joined several Greek
letter fraternities, and were having their share of college
life. They wanted to make the Varsity football team, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
failed, as there was an overabundance of material that fall.
However they did make the Freshman team, and proved
themselves worthy of the honor. But as I intend to tell
of the prowess of the Smith boys on the gridiron in a book
to follow this, I will merely mention now that Bill, Pete
and Cap did more than their share of work in winning
the Freshman championship for the school, after many
hard-fought battles.</p>

<p>The final game on the gridiron had been played, and the
Westfield Varsity had won. Long hair was sacrificed to the
barber&#8217;s shears, dirty suits and leather pads were laid
away, and nose guards and helmets put upon the shelf
until another fall. Then began a winter of more or less
discontent, according as the lads liked or disliked study.
Our heroes were about the average, neither better nor
worse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was rather a more balmy feeling to the air than
had been noticed in some time. The snow had gone, and
the grass that had been brown and sear was beginning to
take on a tinge of green. Cap Smith, mending a rip in
his big catching mitt looked out of the window, yawned
and stretched lazily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much study?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think I&#8217;m getting the spring fever. How about
you, Pete?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here. I&#8217;m tired of this measly Latin. Say,
where is that new mushroom bat I bought the other day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, unless Whistle-Breeches borrowed it to
prop his window up with. Jove! but it&#8217;s getting warm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like his nerve if he has,&#8221; and Pete made a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
journey to the room of the lad at the end of the corridor,
returning with the stick in question, and followed by the
culprit himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was a <i>new</i> bat,&#8221; said Whistle-Breeches
in extenuation. &#8220;Besides there won&#8217;t be any baseball for a
month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t, eh?&#8221; retorted Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;ll have
the cage up in the gym this week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard something about it,&#8221; admitted Cap. &#8220;Mr.
Windam, the coach, said he&#8217;d soon be on the lookout for
candidates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think we have any show?&#8221; asked Pete eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so. We had a good record from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t count so much here,&#8221; was the opinion of
Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to make the nine, but I&#8217;m
afraid I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you play?&#8221; asked Cap, sizing up his chum
with a professional eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you bat some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did a little better than two eighty-nine last year,&#8221;
was the modest answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you ought to get in all right. Now I want to
catch, and Bill wants to pitch,&#8221; went on Cap, &#8220;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d like to fill it at short,&#8221; interrupted Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; came from Bill. &#8220;It would
look too much like a family affair if we were all on the
nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;If they
want good players&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll take us,&#8221; declared Cap with a laugh. &#8220;Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
even if we can&#8217;t make the Varsity, we&#8217;ll have some games.
I wish the ground would dry up a bit, so we could get out
and have some practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill leaned forward and looked from the window, which
gave a view of a path leading to the gymnasium. On a
post not far away from the building was a bulletin board,
and at that moment Forbes Graydon, captain of the Varsity
nine, was tacking something up on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder what that is?&#8221; asked Bill idly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go look,&#8221; proposed Pete. &#8220;Come on, Whistle-Breeches.&#8221;</p>

<p>They hurried down, and after a hasty reading of the
placard waved their hands to Cap and Bill, who soon joined
them, together with a throng of other students.</p>

<p>For the notice gave announcement that all who wished
to try for the baseball team were to report in the Gymnasium
that afternoon, when matters pertaining to the organization
of the nine would be talked over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go, fellows?&#8221; asked Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go? You couldn&#8217;t keep me back if you hitched me to
the Seniors&#8217; meteorite,&#8221; declared Bill with energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to try for it, Bondy?&#8221; asked Whistle-Breeches
of their wealthy neighbor at Bill&#8217;s end of the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? No. Baseball is such a rough and dirty game.
But I shall cheer for our team, and back it with my money,
of course. Do you think we have a chance to win the
championship? I&#8217;d like to wager something on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you and your money!&#8221; growled Whistle-Breeches
as he turned away in disgust. &#8220;We play ball at Westfield
for the <i>game</i>&mdash;not for <i>bets</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>&#8220;Ah&mdash;really!&#8221; exclaimed James Guilder in supercilious
tones as he wiped his glasses with his silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd in the gymnasium that afternoon,
when Mr. Windam, who occupied the platform with Captain
Graydon and J. Evans Green, the manager, banged
his gavel for order.</p>

<p>&#8220;You all know why we are here, so there is no use wasting
time going over that,&#8221; said Mr. Windam. &#8220;There are
several vacancies on the Varsity nine, and we shall be
glad to have new candidates announce themselves. You
new men will all be given a fair try-out, and those who do
not make the team will become substitutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might add, though you probably all know it, that
we won the pennant last year by only a narrow margin.
It is going to be hard to keep it this year, for I understand
Tuckerton College, our most formidable rival, has
an exceptionally strong team, and they are after our
scalps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they won&#8217;t get &#8217;em!&#8221; Voice from the throng.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if we can help it,&#8221; went on the coach. &#8220;Only I
want to warn you that we expect top-notch playing from
every member of the team. Financially we are in good
shape, and just as soon as the candidates can be picked out
we&#8217;ll begin work in the cage. This week, if possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Green, Captain Graydon and myself will
take your names if you will come forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s hesitation, and then Cap Smith,
with a look at his two brothers, arose and walked toward
the platform. There was a murmur in the throng as Pete
and Bill followed, and as Whistle-Breeches got up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>&#8220;The whole Smith family!&#8221; called a voice, and there
was a snicker of mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe we&#8217;ll be glad of more of the Smith boys
before the season is over,&#8221; said Mr. Windam good-naturedly.
&#8220;Now boys, your names, and the positions you&#8217;d like to
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>The organization of the Westfield nine was under way,
and as Cap and his brothers noted the number of candidates
they began to fear that their chance of all being together
on the team was a slim one.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">BILL IS HIT</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Well</span>,&#8221; asked Mr. Windam, as Cap stood before him.
&#8220;What name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith&mdash;John.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um. Spell it with a &#8216;Y&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. Just plain Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; and the position?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got three, but never mind. Accidents will happen.
Next!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith,&#8221; said Bill laconically. &#8220;Plain Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. And you&#8217;d like to be&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pitcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good again, as Mr. Pumblechook would say. Do you
know Mr. Pumblechook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slightly,&#8221; answered Bill, as he recalled his Dickens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pitcher; eh?&#8221; mused the coach, as he jotted Bill&#8217;s name
down. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got about seven candidates, but the more the
merrier. Glass arms are catching. Next!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith&mdash;Peter,&#8221; and the third member of the well-known
family stood forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott! Any more? What is this anyhow, a family
affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a laugh, and Mr. Windam wrote Pete&#8217;s name
down with &#8220;shortstop&#8221; opposite it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>&#8220;Not so bad,&#8221; the coach murmured. &#8220;We need a good
man at short, and you look as if you&#8217;d fill the bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sawed-off smiled in a gratified manner, and the taking
of names proceeded. There was a large number of candidates,
and they appeared promising, the coach, captain and
manager agreed as they looked them over later. Then,
announcing that work in the cage would start in two days,
and admonishing the lads to be on hand, and do their best,
the meeting was called to a close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think we&#8217;ll make it?&#8221; asked Bill anxiously as he and
his brothers, together with Whistle-Breeches, walked to
their rooms, to at least make a pretense of reading and
studying.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will if work is going to count for anything,&#8221;
declared Cap.</p>

<p>The work soon began, and within the next few days
there was a considerable weeding-out.</p>

<p>Our heroes were lucky, or, rather their former good
playing stood them in excellent stead, and they, together
with their friend of the former corduroy trousers, were
among the fit survivors. True they were not assured of
any particular positions on the team, but they realized that
they would be fortunate if they made the Varsity at all.
In batting Pete did better than either of his brothers, and
he received some compliments from the coach.</p>

<p>Cap was on the anxious seat regarding his position behind
the bat, and it was not until on one occasion he did
some fearless work, and demonstrated a good throwing
ability that he drew from the coach and captain a word
of praise that meant much.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll do, &#8216;Plain&#8217; Smith,&#8221; said the coach with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a reassuring smile. &#8220;Of course I can&#8217;t tell until I see you
out of doors, but you look good to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about Bill?&#8221; asked Cap anxiously, for he wanted
to see his brother fill the twirling box, and he knew that
the control Bill had of the ball, his curving ability, and his
lasting qualities would win him a place if he had a fair
try-out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the somewhat dubious answer.
&#8220;Alex Mersfeld pitched all last season, and naturally he&#8217;s
entitled to it again. He&#8217;s our star man, but of course if
your brother is better&mdash;well, we&#8217;ve got to have the best&mdash;that&#8217;s
all. I don&#8217;t play any favorites.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this Cap had to be content.</p>

<p>Spring came with a rush, the ground dried up, and two
weeks after the applications for the team were all in out-of-door
practice was ordered. Then the ranks were further
thinned, but our heroes and Whistle-Breeches still held
their own.</p>

<p>Cap was slated as first substitute catcher, and Pete was
honored with a firm place on the Varsity as shortstop.
But with Bill it was different. Mersfeld held his old position,
and there was no denying that he had a good arm.</p>

<p>Still, when Bill got a chance to show what he could do
he opened the eyes of the coach and captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we ever need to take Mersfeld out there&#8217;s a chap
who can fill the box to perfection,&#8221; declared Mr. Windam.
&#8220;I almost wish we could play him regularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s only a Fresh,&#8221; objected the captain, &#8220;and if
we put the three Smith boys on the team, it&#8217;ll be said we
are trying to make a family affair of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t help it&mdash;we want to win.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>And, as the days went on the Smith boys further
demonstrated their abilities. Practice was now held regularly
and there were games between the Varsity and scrub
nines, Bill pitching on the latter team. His curves were
a source of wonder and delight to his team mates, and
chagrin to his opponents, and on one occasion, when they
did not get a hit off him in five innings, the coach shook
his head in doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about it,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;If he keeps on
improving as he has he&#8217;ll displace Mersfeld.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said the captain easily.</p>

<p>It was one afternoon toward the close of a practice game,
when the scrub was one run ahead, and the coach was
exhorting the Varsity lads to &#8220;perk up,&#8221; and put some
ginger into the contest. Bill was in the box, and had
been doing some excellent work for the scrub when Graydon,
of the Varsity, came up to the bat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s a chance to strike me out!&#8221; he called good-naturedly.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t I&#8217;m going to make a home run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better go sit down now,&#8221; replied Bill, as
he wound up for a swift out. It went from his hand with
a speedy whizz, and the batter caught it squarely on his
stick. There was a resounding whack, and the ball came
straight for Bill, at about the level of his head.</p>

<p>He put up his hands for it, instinctively, but so swift
was the horsehide sphere traveling that it broke through
and hit him on the head, just over the left eye. He
dropped like a stone, and Graydon, tossing aside his bat,
raced for the fallen lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove old man!&#8221; he cried contritely, all thoughts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the game forgotten. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for that. Wow! But
that&#8217;s a nasty bump!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Bill was lying in Graydon&#8217;s arms, unconscious,
while a big lump was swelling up on the pitcher&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some water!&#8221; cried Graydon, and they brought the
pail. Pete and Cap hastened up, as did Mr. Windam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t cut off all the air,&#8221; said the coach. &#8220;Harris,
perhaps you&#8217;d better ask Dr. Blasdell to step down,&#8221;
there being a physician on the school&#8217;s staff of teachers.</p>

<p>But Bill opened his eyes as the cold water trickled
down his face, and murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m all right. I&#8217;m not hurt&mdash;just a little dizzy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it easy, old man,&#8221; advised the coach. &#8220;A little
more water. Here, Snyder, mix a little of that aromatic
spirits of ammonia. You&#8217;ll find the bottle in my valise,&#8221;
for Mr. Windam kept a few simple remedies in readiness
for first aid to the injured.</p>

<p>Soon Bill was much better, and there was no need for
the services of Dr. Blasdell, who came hurrying down at
the summons. He found that there was no apparent injury
to Bill&#8217;s skull, and the plucky pitcher wanted to go
on with the game, but they would not hear of it, and put
another man in, while our hero was taken to his room to
lie down. The Varsity won the game, but took little
credit for it, and when the contest was over there were
many inquiries for Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how do you feel?&#8221; asked Pete the next day, as
his brother got up and looked in the glass at the strip of
plaster over the big bump, for the skin was broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel as though I tried to stop a taxicab with my
head. Dizzy, you know. But I guess it will pass over.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>He felt much better as the day passed, and wanted to
get into practice that afternoon, but the coach would not
let him.</p>

<p>However, on the following afternoon, Bill insisted so
strenuously that he was allowed to get into a uniform,
and take his place on the diamond. There was no game,
but he and Cap did some work together.</p>

<p>The first few balls Bill pitched went a bit wild, and
his brother did not pay much attention to them, but when,
after he had delivered about the seventh one, and it went
wide of the plate, Cap called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get &#8217;em over, Bill. They&#8217;re a bit too far out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too wide! What&#8217;s the matter? That cut off as big
a corner of the plate as you&#8217;d want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? It was four inches out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Bill. &#8220;You can&#8217;t see straight.
Here, how&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The ball shot from his hand, but Bill had to step some
distance out to gather it into his big mitt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Worser and worser,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;Guess
your vacation didn&#8217;t do you any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded Bill somewhat
peevishly. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting those over all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s something the matter with your eyes,&#8221;
declared his brother seriously, and he looked anxiously at
the younger lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch this!&#8221; called Bill.</p>

<p>He threw very carefully but he seemed to lose control
of the ball, which ability was one of his best features.
It again went wide, and Cap had to reach out for the
sphere.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>The catcher shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are your eyes, Bill?&#8221; he asked kindly, walking
toward his brother. &#8220;Maybe the jar they got when you
were hit, sort of put them on the blink for a few days.
Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how it could be. Just try a few more.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did, but Cap only shook his head. Other players
were noticing something wrong, and as soon as Cap saw
this he called the practice off.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had enough for to-day,&#8221; he declared, as though
it was of no consequence, but Bill knew that his brother&#8217;s
light tone covered a deeper meaning. There was a vague
alarm in the heart of the lad who aspired to be the Varsity
pitcher.</p>

<p>Was his eyesight going back on him? Was he losing
his control? What ailed him?</p>

<p>He hardly dared answer, yet he resolved to put it to the
test soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;My head does feel a little queer,&#8221; he admitted to himself,
and much against his will. &#8220;And my eyes&mdash;my eyes&mdash;I
wonder if there can be anything wrong?&#8221; and he
walked moodily off the diamond, while Cap and Pete
gazed apprehensively after him.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE DOCTOR&#8217;S VERDICT</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Maybe</span> if you take a few days&#8217; rest you&#8217;ll be all right,
Bill,&#8221; suggested Pete a little later, when the brothers
were in their connecting rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; agreed Cap eagerly. &#8220;A rest will do you
good, Bill, and then you&#8217;ll be in shape for the try-out just
before the first league game. Take a good rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not tired,&#8221; protested Bill who sat in a corner
nervously fingering his pitching glove. &#8220;Why should I
need a rest?&#8221; He asked the question fiercely as though
there was some disgrace attached to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your eyes,&#8221; said Cap. &#8220;You know you&#8217;re off in
your pitching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&mdash;I did rotten to-day, and if I&#8217;d been in
a game they&#8217;d have knocked me out of the box. But I&#8217;ll
be all right in a few days more. That lump is still as sore
as the mischief,&#8221; and he tenderly felt of the place where
the batted ball had hit him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you don&#8217;t get all right?&#8221; asked Cap softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll see a doctor!&#8221; exclaimed Bill with energy.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to lose a chance to pitch on the Varsity
this season, and I believe I will have a chance. I&#8217;ve been
watching Mersfeld, and he&#8217;s not such a wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anything of him,&#8221; admitted Cap.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught for him in a couple of practice games, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
he hasn&#8217;t half your speed, though he has some nice
curves, and a good control. I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d last
through a hard game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll fix Bill up, and have him on the Varsity
yet,&#8221; declared Pete easily. He could afford to speak thus
for he was sure of his own position at short, and Cap had
at least a tentative promise of being behind the bat in
a number of the big games that would soon be played.</p>

<p>The brothers talked over the situation, and then fell
to studying, with more or less energy, until interrupted
by the entrance of Whistle-Breeches and Dick, or
&#8220;Roundy,&#8221; Lawson, the genial senior having gotten into
the habit lately of calling on his neighbors.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; demanded Whistle-Breeches as he noticed
Bill&#8217;s rather dejected attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m on the blink. Can&#8217;t see to throw straight,&#8221;
and then the story, which was already known to several in
the school, was told.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is,&#8221; began Lawson, and his words
were carefully listened to, as befitted a Senior. &#8220;You
want to see a doctor, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Doc. Blasdell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s all right for a pain on your insides, but I
mean an eye doctor&mdash;an oculist. I know a good one.
I had trouble with my eyes once, and I went to him. He
can fix you up. Maybe there&#8217;s a little strain which some
medicine will cure. Why don&#8217;t you go to see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I will. It&#8217;s tough to be knocked out before
the season starts. I&#8217;ll go to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they fell to talking of the baseball prospects,
how this player was making out at first, another in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the field, what the chances were for good batters, the
prospects of Westfield holding the pennant, and kindred
matters.</p>

<p>All the while Bill sat in a darkened corner, for Lawson
had insisted on this since his advent into the room, saying
that darkness was good for weak eyes. And poor Bill
fingered his pitching glove, wondering if he would ever
get back into the box again. Cap was straightening a
bent wire in his mask and Pete was re-winding some tape
on a favorite bat that always opened at the split every
time he used it. But he could not bring himself to throw
it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind now,&#8221; stipulated Lawson, as he and Whistle-Breeches
took their leave, &#8220;you see that eye man to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bill promised.</p>

<p>They went to the oculist&#8217;s together, Cap and Bill, and
the pitcher was put through a number of tests. He sat
and looked at candles, while the medical man put a lens
in front of the lights, and turned the glass sideways to
make the single image develop into two. Then when Bill
admitted that the two lights were not on the same level
(as they should have been to one of normal vision) the
oculist shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>Next he looked through the eye away into the
back of Bill&#8217;s head, with a queerly constructed instrument,
and reflected glaring lights into the lad&#8217;s orbs until
he blinked in pain. Reading cards of different size type,
taking a stick, and trying to impale a series of concentric
circles, first with his left eye closed and then with the
right one shut, ended the test.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; announced the oculist at length, &#8220;it&#8217;s not as
bad as it might be. Your left eye is considerably out of
focus, and I should say it was caused by some pressure
on the optic nerve&mdash;possibly the result of that blow with
the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can be done about it?&#8221; demanded Bill with
a note of despair in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, nothing much. In time it may readjust itself,
and again&mdash;it may not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that I&#8217;ll always be this way&mdash;not able
to throw straight?&#8221; demanded the pitcher almost springing
up from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy now, old man,&#8221; cautioned Cap in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t I ever be able to throw straight again?&#8221; cried
poor Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; answered the doctor. &#8220;Of course if
the pressure on the nerve could be removed it would be
possible, but that would take an operation, and I don&#8217;t
recommend it. In fact it might make matters worse.
But it&#8217;s not so bad. It will cause you no annoyance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No annoyance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit. You can see as well as ever. You can
read, write, walk about, in fact only in matters requiring
a critical judge of distance will you be at all hampered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s just it!&#8221; cried Bill. &#8220;I <i>need</i> to be a judge
of distance if I&#8217;m going to pitch on the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but you can&#8217;t pitch any more,&#8221; was the
doctor&#8217;s verdict, and to Bill, who like his brothers had
his whole soul wrapped up in baseball, the words sounded
like a doom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not pitch any more?&#8221; repeated Bill dully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>&#8220;Not until that nerve pressure is removed,&#8221; was the
answer, &#8220;and I advise against any operation for that.
I can fit you with a pair of glasses that will take off any
strain when you are reading, and that&#8217;s all you need.
But you can&#8217;t pitch&mdash;that is if you have to be accurate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s just what I have to be,&#8221; murmured Bill.
&#8220;Not pitch any more&mdash;not pitch any more,&#8221; and he
covered his eyes with his hand, and swayed uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&mdash;there old man!&#8221; spoke Cap, a trifle hoarsely,
for he was much affected by the way his brother had
taken the blow that had fallen. &#8220;Maybe it won&#8217;t be as
bad as it seems. You may get better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill shook his head despondently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said to his brother. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll come back
for the reading glasses later, doctor. I&mdash;I don&#8217;t just feel
like it now,&#8221; and Cap linked his arm in that of Bill&#8217;s and
led him away, the footsteps seeming to recite mockingly
over and over again, like some death knell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t&mdash;pitch&mdash;any&mdash;more! You can&#8217;t&mdash;pitch&mdash;any&mdash;more!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">MEETING AN OLD FRIEND</p>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some time after leaving the doctor&#8217;s office neither
Cap nor Bill spoke. The latter stumbled along, his mind
filled with gloomy thoughts, and as for Cap he was wondering
what he could say to take the pain from his
brother&#8217;s heart. Wisely he concluded that he could say
nothing. At length Bill spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be worse,&#8221; replied Cap, as cheerfully as he
could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse!&#8221; Bill laughed mirthlessly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why you might be blind, or not able to see to read
or get about without wearing goggles and using a cane. As
it is you only needed specs to read with. And maybe the
nerve will get well of itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, after the season is over, and I lose all chance
of playing on the Varsity. I tell you I want to pitch,
Cap. That&#8217;s one reason why we picked out Westfield,&mdash;because
of the good nines they have here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it; but what&#8217;s to be done? If you can&#8217;t control
the balls, and place them where they ought to be,
you know&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know how it is,&#8221; and he spoke bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;d
be of no use in the box. Well, I s&#8217;pose there&#8217;s no help
for it,&#8221; and Bill picked up a round stone, and threw it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
at a telegraph pole. He missed it by a foot, though
usually he was a good shot. He laughed mirthlessly, and
turning to Cap said: &#8220;See how it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, don&#8217;t take it so hard. That was a nasty
blow you got, and the effects may be a long time wearing
away. But I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be all right next season, if
you&#8217;re not this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a whole season off the diamond!&#8221; gasped Bill in
dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t need to get off. Maybe Windam will
play you in the outfield. You can catch; can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I want to be in the box. However if I can&#8217;t&mdash;I
can&#8217;t,&#8221; and seeing that he was causing Cap pain by
his manner, Bill tried to assume a more cheerful air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Graydon will be cut up over it,&#8221; said the elder lad,
referring to the player whose batted ball had been responsible
for Bill&#8217;s mishap.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his fault,&#8221; declared the pitcher. &#8220;I ought
to have known better than to try to stop it at such close
range. It was going like a bullet. I should have passed
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t&mdash;and be a Smith boy,&#8221; exclaimed Cap
with a laugh. &#8220;We&#8217;d take a chance on anything in the
shape of a ball, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go back in a couple of days, and get the
reading glasses, and maybe they&#8217;ll help some,&#8221; decided
Bill, as they walked on. They were nearing the college,
the many buildings of which could be seen in the distance
above the trees, the red tiled roofs making a pretty
picture seen through the green foliage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, something&#8217;s going on!&#8221; exclaimed Cap, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
they swung into the main road that led up to the grounds.
&#8220;Look at the crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baseball game?&#8221; suggested Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re away this side of the diamond. There&#8217;s
some sort of a wagon there&mdash;a Gypsy van, I guess.
Maybe some of the fellows are having their fortunes
told. Come on, we&#8217;ll get in the game, and have some
fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s an ambulance, and some one is hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out! They don&#8217;t have ambulances around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brothers increased their pace, and as they neared
the vehicle something vaguely familiar about it attracted
the attention of Bill and Cap. They looked at each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be him!&#8221; exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like his rig, though,&#8221; assented Cap. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s painted a different color. I wonder&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; cautioned his brother.</p>

<p>They were close to the throng of students now, but
could only see the top of the wagon, which was a covered
one. A voice could be heard droning away like this:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young gentlemen, it is one of the greatest pleasures
of my life to speak to students&mdash;to persons of learning,
in which class I am so fortunate as to count myself,
though in an humble capacity. Learning, I may say, extends
even to the noble steed which draws my equipage,
whose cognomen is, I may say derived from&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, old sport, what&#8217;s the horse called?&#8221;
demanded one of the students, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, get down to business,&#8221; added another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are, young gentlemen,&#8221; admitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
voice, though Bill and Cap could not yet see the speaker.
They observed their brother Pete beckoning frantically
to them, and they increased their pace. &#8220;Right you are,&#8221;
resumed the owner of the covered wagon. &#8220;The name
of my noble animal is Pactolus, called after, I need not
remind you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The river of Lydia in which the King Midas washed
himself one Saturday night, so that he put the golden
touch on everything,&#8221; interrupted one of the classical
students, and there was a laugh, but it did not disconcert
the traveling vendor, for such Bill and Cap now
knew him to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;The river whence ever
after the visit of the king, the sands became golden.
Thus I named my horse Pactolus in the hope that some
day he might stumble into a river which, if it did not
turn him to gold might at least make him a steed of
silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, young gentlemen of Westfield, which I understand
is the name of the school in the distance, I did
not attract you hither by the magic of my voice and
playing to talk to you on classical subjects. This is a
practical world, and we who live in it must also be practical.
Whoa, there, Pactolus!&#8221; This as his steed showed
signs of restiveness, due to the fact that some of the
boys were tickling his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa, Pactolus. Never mind if some of your longer-eared
brothers are whispering to you to entice you away
to pastures green&mdash;stay you here!&#8221;</p>

<p>This reference to donkeys had the effect of causing
the mischief loving lads to hastily draw away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
horse, in some confusion, for there were snickers at their
expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a practical world,&#8221; resumed the speaker, &#8220;and
we must recognize that, and be practical ourselves. Now
there is nothing more practical for the removal of any
kind of misery, whether inward or outward, than my
Peerless Permanent Pain Preventative, which is good
for both man and beast, and eradicates all the ills that
flesh is heir to, and some that it is not. Good for man
and beast I repeat. See! I use it on myself,&#8221; and suiting
the action to the word, the man, who had black
flowing locks, as Bill and Cap could now see, and who
wore light trousers, a red and green striped vest and a
red shirt with black polka dots&mdash;this man vigorously
rubbed some stuff from a bottle on his big forearm.</p>

<p>&#8220;There I had a pain&mdash;&#8217;twas there, &#8217;tis gone. &#8217;Twas
mine, &#8217;tis yours&mdash;for the asking,&#8221; and he waved his
hand toward the throng of students who laughed again,
and seemed amused by the clatter of the traveling medicine
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think not it is only for external pain&mdash;&#8217;tis also for the
ills of the inner organs. See, I take some thusly,&#8221; and, tilting
back his head the speaker swallowed a generous potion
from the bottle. &#8220;Good for man and beast,&#8221; he went on,
smacking his lips. &#8220;As harmless as a baby, and as powerful
as an electric current. See, Pactolus minds it not, yet it
will take the stiffness from him like magic,&#8221; and, leaning
forward he rubbed some of the contents of the bottle on
the animal&#8217;s flank.</p>

<p>Pactolus merely looked around, waved his ears slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to and fro, and seemed to take but a mild interest in the
matter under discussion. Probably he was used to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now who wants a bottle of this wonderful remedy?&#8221;
went on the man. &#8220;The regular price is one dollar, but to
introduce it among gentlemen of learning I am selling it
for the small sum of twenty-five cents&mdash;a quarter&mdash;and it
would be cheap at half the price. Or, if you have no immediate
need for this, let me introduce to your favorable consideration
and notice, my Rapid Robust Resolute Resolvent,
which is a cake of soap guaranteed to take out stains
on linen, silk, wool, cotton, velvet, calico and satin, the skin
of the hands or face, from wall paper, newspaper, writing
paper or wrapping paper. Positively nothing like it
known to science.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, if you care not for these, I have others. My Spotless
Saponifier is a soap worthy to be used by all the gods
that on Olympus dwell, and it sells for only ten cents a
cake. An&#8217; you like that not, let me introduce to your polite
and favorable consideration my Supremely Sterling
Silver Shiner. Nothing like it known for cleaning silver,
gold, brass, copper, pewter, iron, lead, bell-metal, watch
chains, baseball bats, and gloves, and for brightening up a
dull intellect it has no equal, though I despair of selling
any for that purpose when I gaze on the bright, smiling
and intelligent faces before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a mocking groan from the students at this,
and some more laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; went on the vendor, &#8220;who will be the first
to purchase some of my Peerless Permanent Pain Preventative,
my Rapid Robust Resolute Resolvent, my Spotless
Saponifier or the Supremely Sterling Silver Shiner? Who
will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> the first?&#8221; and the man, who was as gaudily attired
as his wagon was painted, advanced into the crowd.</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation, and then Cap, Bill
and Pete, who were standing together, exchanging queer
glances, heard Bondy Guilder say in a low voice to some of
his particular cronies in the sporting set:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, fellows, let&#8217;s have some fun. Let&#8217;s upset his
old apple cart, and spill his Pain Killer and other stuff.
He has nerve, trying to do business so near the school.
There ought to be a rule to keep these peddlers away.
Let&#8217;s make a rough house for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Go ahead! We&#8217;re with you!&#8221; agreed several.
&#8220;Come on, we&#8217;ll all make a rush together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cap and his brothers heard. They looked at each other
and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are, young gentlemen! Here you are!&#8221; the
voice of the vendor was murmuring. &#8220;You have listened
with gratifying attention to the patter of Professor Theophilus
Clatter, and now you may buy his wares. You
need not beware of the wares of Theophilus Clatter!&#8221; he
declaimed in a sing-song voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him!&#8221; exclaimed Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re going to make a rough house for him,&#8221;
added Cap. &#8220;Shall we stand for it?&#8221; he asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are we going to stop them?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we say he&#8217;s a friend of ours I think they&#8217;ll pass it
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Acknowledge him as our friend before this crowd&mdash;tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
how we traveled with him and sold patent medicines,&#8221;
asked Pete. &#8220;They&#8217;d laugh at us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; inquired Cap indignantly. &#8220;Professor
Clatter helped us when we were in a hole, after we&#8217;d run
away from home. It&#8217;s up to us to help him now. I&#8217;m
going to stand up for him. If the boys get going they&#8217;ll
demolish the wagon, and everything in it. We can&#8217;t have
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; agreed Pete and Bill in low tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on then,&#8221; suggested their elder brother, edging
his way through the throng.</p>

<p>The plan proposed by the rich bully had taken the fancy
of his fellows. The word was passed around and the students
got ready for a rush that would overturn the wagon.
Already they were jostling the professor who was aware
of a change in the temper of the students. He looked
around uneasily, and glanced back at his wagon. Quite a
throng was now between him and the vehicle. He turned
to retreat, vaguely alarmed, but found himself cut off.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Rapid Robust Resolute Resolvent,&#8221; he was saying,
&#8220;is guaranteed to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on now, fellows, over with the wagon!&#8221; cried
Guilder. &#8220;Altogether, with a rush! Make a rough house!
This faker has no business here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The rush started but before it could get under way,
Cap, Pete and Bill Smith had sprung up on the steps that
were let down from the back of the vehicle. They stood
together looking over the crowd of their fellow students.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; cried Cap calmly, raising his hand for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; demanded Bondy with a sneer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Professor Clatter, with a look of wonder on his face was
staring at the three Smith boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;No rough house here,&#8221; said Cap determinedly, noting
with relief that nearly every one in the crowd was a Freshman.
Had they been Sophomores, Juniors or Seniors he
would hardly have dared take the stand he did.</p>

<p>&#8220;No rough house? Why not?&#8221; demanded the rich lad.
&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we have some fun with this fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; went on Cap resolutely, and no one knew
what an effort it was to make the announcement in an exclusive
crowd of students, &#8220;this man is a friend of my brothers
and myself. If you&#8217;re going to make trouble for him,
you&#8217;ve got to reckon on us,&#8221; and Cap standing there, with
his brothers beside him, looked sturdy enough to put up a
pretty good argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend?&#8221; sneered Bondy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friend,&#8221; repeated Cap calmly. &#8220;So you&#8217;ll please
pass him up, as a matter of class courtesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an appeal that could not well be denied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to Professor Clatter&#8217;s friend!&#8221; cried several of
Bondy&#8217;s cronies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Proud to acknowledge it,&#8221; put in Bill in drawling tones,
&#8220;and so would you, if you knew the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Clatter was still staring at the three lads on
the steps of his wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Smith boys! The Smith boys!&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;I&#8217;d never have believed it. Whoa, Pactolus! We have
unexpected allies,&#8221; and he made his way through the
crowd of wondering students to where our three heroes
waited for him on the wagon steps.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">PROFESSOR CLATTER&#8217;S PLAN</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Standing</span> there, facing their fellow students who were
gathered in a mocking crowd about the medicine wagon,
Cap, Bill and Pete hardly knew how to begin, nor what
to talk about after they had started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say you&#8217;re going to stick up for&mdash;for
<i>this</i> person?&#8221; demanded Bondy, and he put all the scorn
of which he was capable into the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly do,&#8221; declared Cap firmly. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll let
us explain, we&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young gentlemen, permit me,&#8221; broke in the voice of
Professor Clatter. &#8220;I believe I can&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more of your patent medicine jargon!&#8221; interrupted
some of Guilder&#8217;s cronies. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to speak of my wares,&#8221; said the vendor
simply. &#8220;I hope you will give me credit for knowing how
to deal with gentlemen&mdash;when I see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this, and the Professor knew he
had at least some of his audience with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to ask my friends, the Smith boys, to allow
me to make the explanation,&#8221; Mr. Clatter went on. &#8220;I
believe I can give all the facts necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at Cap, who nodded an assent. Then, mounting
the steps beside the lads, the vendor of the Peerless
Permanent Pain Preventative and the various other nostrums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
told simply, but effectively, how, one morning, he
had met our three heroes as they were fleeing from home,
under the mistaken notion that they were to be tarred and
feathered. Mr. Clatter related how he had provided them
with breakfast from his wagon, how they had traveled
about with him, selling his goods, taking part in a sort of
minstrel show, all as related in the first volume of this
series.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I was arrested for innocently practicing
palmistry, in an effort to locate a man who had robbed their
father, these boys kept on with the business alone, and
made money enough to pay my fine,&#8221; said the professor.
&#8220;I can never thank them enough for what they did, and
now they have more than ever put me in their debt by
standing up in this friendly fashion for me when&mdash;well,
I know you young gentlemen love fun, but this wagon and
stock is all I have in the world,&#8221; he concluded simply, and
there was a break in his voice.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, and then the story, which
the professor told much more dramatically than either of
our heroes could have presented it, had its effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! That was no end of a lark!&#8221; exclaimed
Roundy Lawson. &#8220;I wish I could travel around like that,
and eat when I pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was <i>rich</i>!&#8221; declared Whistle-Breeches Anderson.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ever tell us that, Cap?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought you fellows would care about hearing
it. But now, boys, do you blame us for sticking up for
Mr. Clatter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it!&#8221; came in an emphatic chorus. &#8220;You&#8217;re
all right, professor!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>&#8220;Pass out some of that Rapid Resolute Resolvent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want some of that Spotless Soap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for the Pain Killer. I ate too much dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little silver polish will about suit me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The students were clamoring for the wares, now, and the
vendor, who had shaken hands with our heroes, and whispered
to them how grateful he was, began passing out his
goods. Whether the students really wanted it, or only
bought out of sympathy, or because of a class spirit, mattered
little as long as he sold the articles, and the professor
did a thriving trade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; disgustedly called the rich lad to the cronies
in his own particular set, &#8220;I might have known better than
to come to Westfield. I was warned that a number of
common persons attended it, and now I&#8217;m sure of it. I
shall write father and have him withdraw me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you withdraw yourself, and save daddy the
trouble?&#8221; asked Whistle-Breeches as the rich lad passed
on amid his chums, with a sneer on his face.</p>

<p>All danger to the professor&#8217;s wagon was now over, and
he at once made friends among the students, for he was a
man who had traveled much, and his ways, while suiting his
particular business, were genial and kindly when once you
knew him, though at first they might seem bombastic and
uncultured. He knew how to gain the attention of an
audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a real pleasure to see you boys again,&#8221; went
on the professor when the desire of the crowd for his wares
had been satisfied, and when most of the students had
strolled away. &#8220;And so you are attending school here?
Well, what has happened since last we met?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>&#8220;Lots,&#8221; declared Cap, and he proceeded to tell the main
facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you still traveling about in the same way?&#8221; asked
Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t do any more palmistry. It&#8217;s too risky.
But what&#8217;s the matter with you, Bill? You don&#8217;t seem
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got hit with a ball,&#8221; explained the lad, touching the
place where there was still a lump on his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad, but you&#8217;ll soon be over it. Pactolus once
kicked me, and it was a week before the swelling went
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The swelling is the least part of it,&#8221; spoke Bill gloomily,
and Pete, who had not yet heard of the result of the
visit to the oculist, looked in alarm at his brother&#8217;s tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; inquired Mr. Clatter. &#8220;Perhaps
some of my pain killer will help you. It&#8217;s good stuff in
spite of the way I sell it. I used to know something of
medicine. Let me wrap you up a bottle for old times&#8217;
sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Bill wearily, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t the pain. But I
can&#8217;t pitch any more,&#8221; and he told the whole story, sitting
inside the wagon, which was equipped for living in Gypsy
fashion, his brothers and the professor listening sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t pitch; eh?&#8221; murmured Pete. &#8220;That&#8217;s tough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure is,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve got to wear glasses
when I read. I might as well resign from the team right
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Clatter looked critically at the lad who sat
near him. Though it had been many years since the vendor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
had played ball, he had not lost his love for the game,
though he never belonged to a regular nine. But he appreciated
what it meant to Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you get your reading glasses?&#8221; he asked
casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m in no hurry to become a &#8216;four-eyes,&#8217;&#8221; replied
Bill bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get them next week. Jove, but it&#8217;s
tough!&#8221; and he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we must be getting back,&#8221; said Cap, after a pause.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some boning to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; added Pete. But Bill got up in silence to
follow his brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you come and see me again?&#8221; asked Professor
Clatter anxiously as his young friends descended the steps.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay in this neighborhood for some days and
I&#8217;d like to talk over old times with you. Yes, Pactolus,
I&#8217;m going to unharness you, and let you crop of the green
herbage,&#8221; and he proceeded to release the horse from the
shafts. &#8220;Pactolus and I understand each other,&#8221; he went
on. &#8220;At least he knows what I say to him, though I have
not yet mastered his language. It takes Dean Swift for
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he stumbled into the river of gold yet?&#8221; asked
Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, but I look at every stream eagerly as we pass
over or through it, when it is not too deep. Some day
perhaps the sands will be golden,&#8221; and the medicine man
laughed gaily. &#8220;But do come out and see me some night
when you have a chance. I&#8217;m going to camp on the other
side of town. Come out to-night, if you will. I&#8217;ll probably
have an old friend there to greet you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Pete. &#8220;Not the thumbless man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s safe in jail, I hope. But what would you say
to Duodecimo Donaldby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The weather prophet?&#8221; asked Bill, with a show of
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; answered the professor, &#8220;though whether he
is still engaged in making it rain, or whether he is doctoring
horses I know not. He changes his occupation from
day to day, and from night to night, like the phases of the
moon, but I expect him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll come,&#8221; decided Cap earnestly. &#8220;I should
like to see him again. Dear old Duodecimo! He was a
queer chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he hasn&#8217;t changed any,&#8221; was the professor&#8217;s opinion.
&#8220;Well, I shall expect you then. Remember, on the other
side of town. Now can&#8217;t I give you some soap, or pain
killer or&mdash;or something?&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed so eager about it that they did accept a
bottle of the pain killer, which was excellent for sprains.
Then they took their leave, promising to come back that
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect to do a little business early in the evening so
if I am clattering when you arrive, just wait in the crowd
for me. I still do some singing and banjo playing to draw
a throng. I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose you boys would like a try at your
old job?&#8221; and he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it would hardly be in keeping with our characters
as students at Westfield,&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;But say, if
you&#8217;ll stay around here long enough maybe we can get the
glee club to do a stunt for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be asking too much,&#8221; declared the genial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
professor, with a wave of his fat hand on which still
sparkled the diamond ring. &#8220;Well, farewell until the
shades of night do fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same old professor,&#8221; remarked Cap, as he and his
brothers strolled toward the school buildings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m glad we could help him&mdash;they would have put
him on the blink for keeps,&#8221; said Pete earnestly if a bit
slangily.</p>

<p>Bill said nothing, but there were bitter thoughts in his
heart as he walked on, and nothing his brothers could say
or do served to cheer him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Professor Clatter, standing in the back room
of his wagon, which was his house, his store, his sleeping
apartment and his theatre of entertainment, watched the
three boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine fellows,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;It&#8217;s too bad about Bill.
I wonder if I couldn&#8217;t help him? He&#8217;ll have to wear
glasses&mdash;wear glasses and play ball&mdash;I wonder if it could
be done? I don&#8217;t see why not, especially in the pitcher&#8217;s
box. Now I wonder if Duodecimo will be on hand?</p>

<p>&#8220;If he comes I have a plan to propose to him! Jove, I
don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t work. If he hasn&#8217;t forgotten all
he used to know about eyes it ought to! I&#8217;ll chance it,
anyhow. Yes, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. Maybe I can fix up a
scheme so that Bill can pitch on the Varsity team after all.
I&#8217;d like to. Yes, I&#8217;ll propose it to Duodecimo, and see
what he says,&#8221; and, filled with pleasant anticipations about
his plan, Professor Clatter proceeded to get his simple
meal on the little oil stove he carried in his wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ho! Mercurio!&#8221; he cried, clapping his hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
&#8220;Come, base varlet, set out the magic table, for I am an
hungered and would&#8217;st dine!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, having given his orders to his menial, Mr.
Clatter, highly pleased, proceeded to carry them out himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">BILL IS HIMSELF AGAIN</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, are you coming?&#8221; asked Pete of Bill as he tossed
into a corner of his study one of a pile of books over which
he had been doing more or less &#8220;boning&#8221; in the last hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over to see Professor Clatter. Cap&#8217;s ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Bill spoke listlessly. He had
been trying to study but a curious watery mist came into
his eyes, and, try as he did to brush it away, the film
seemed to return. The eye near the injured spot smarted
and burned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ahead,&#8221; urged Cap, entering his brother&#8217;s room
at that moment. &#8220;Whistle-Breeches wants to go and see
the performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, you fellows go, and I&#8217;ll stay here. I don&#8217;t
care much about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cap winked at Pete. They understood Bill&#8217;s despondency,
and were determined to get him out of the slough of
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;ll be sport&mdash;like old times,&#8221; urged Cap. &#8220;The
professor will do his singing and banjo act, and I&#8217;ve a good
notion to get up on the platform and show Whistle-Breeches
how we used to earn our board and lodging.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not, Bondy might spot us and there&#8217;d be a faculty
row. He&#8217;d be just mean enough to squeal. But
come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> on, Bill. The professor expects us. Say, remember
the time after he got nabbed, and we tried to take the spot
out of the man&#8217;s vest, and it turned green, red, yellow and
a few other colors? Remember that, Cap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say I did!&#8221; exclaimed John Smith. &#8220;I
thought sure it was all up with us,&#8221; and he laughed heartily.
A smile came over Bill&#8217;s gloomy face. Pete saw it
and nudged his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see the rain-maker again,&#8221; went on Pete. &#8220;Better
come, Bill. Don&#8217;t worry about your eyes, and pitching
and all that. Maybe it will come out right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s easy enough for you fellows to talk, for
you can play ball, but&mdash;Oh well, what&#8217;s the use of kicking.
I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll get in form again for next year,&#8221; and with
rather a bitter laugh Bill prepared to follow his brothers.</p>

<p>As they had been on their good behavior of late, and as
there was such a competition for places on the ball team,
it was decided that they should get permission to make
a trip to the village instead of trying to run the guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hankering to have the proctor&#8217;s scouts nab me,&#8221;
explained Cap, &#8220;and I guess we can get a pass all right if
we put it up to Nibsy good and strong,&#8221; the aforesaid proctor
who rejoiced in the appelation Alexander McNibb being
thus designated.</p>

<p>They obtained permission easily, though the proctor
looked at them rather sharply, and Pete wondered if he
recognized in him and his brothers the lads who had, a few
nights previous, wheeled a town sprinkling cart into the
middle of the school inner court and left it there with an
admonition printed on a big placard adorning it, recommending
that certain members of the sporting crowd get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
aboard the water vehicle. But if the proctor knew anything
he kept it to himself, and, a little later the three
Smith boys, and Whistle-Breeches were trudging toward
town.</p>

<p>They saw the glare of the gasoline torches on the professor&#8217;s
wagon before they heard his voice, but it was not
long ere they recognized his resonant tones calling out the
merits of his Rapid Robust Resolute Resolvent and other
wares.</p>

<p>There was a large throng about the wagon, and business
was good. The professor, looking over the heads of his
audience recognized our heroes, and nodded to them pleasantly,
yet never ceasing his &#8220;patter.&#8221; Between the sale
of his remedies and soap, he rendered several ballads accompanying
himself on the banjo.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure does remind me of old times!&#8221; exclaimed Pete,
humming the chorus of the song the professor was singing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out!&#8221; advised Cap hastily.</p>

<p>Bill was not very talkative, but Whistle-Breeches enjoyed
the affair immensely, and was greatly interested in what
Professor Clatter called his &#8220;patter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to get him to some of our class rackets,&#8221;
said Donald. &#8220;He&#8217;d be no end of a lark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he doesn&#8217;t stay in this part of the country long&mdash;nor,
in fact anywhere more than a couple of nights,&#8221;
replied Pete, and, as he spoke he looked beyond the gaudily
decorated vehicle of the medicine vendor and caught a
glimpse of another wagon drawn alongside the road. It
was one with something like a three inch quick-firing gun
projecting from the covered top, and Pete whispered to his
brothers:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s Duodecimo Donaldby&#8217;s rig if I&#8217;ve got my eyesight
left. I wonder if he&#8217;s shooting rain-making bombs
for a living now, or curing sick horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon know,&#8221; said Cap. &#8220;The professor is nearly
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd having exhausted the entertaining features of
the medicine man&#8217;s little effort, and the sale of the remedies
and soaps being about at an end, Mr. Clatter announced
that he was through for the evening. The people
began to disperse, and soon Cap, with his two brothers and
Whistle-Breeches were seated inside the snug little wagon,
enjoying a cup of tea and some cakes which the professor
set before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you boys came,&#8221; he said, as he looked in the
tiny teapot to see how much of the beverage remained.
&#8220;I want to have a talk with you&mdash;but hold on, I was almost
forgetting an old friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped to the window of his vehicle, poked out his
head, and gave a call which was at once answered. Presently
some one was heard approaching, and, as the door
opened the head of the character known to our friends as
the &#8220;rain-maker,&#8221; was thrust inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome to the Smith boys!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enter!&#8221; invited Mr. Clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, come in and talk over old times, Mr. Donaldby,&#8221;
added Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Not that name!&#8221; exclaimed the weather
prophet, with a warning finger laid athwart his lips. &#8220;Not
that name or by a shattered cirrus-nimbus cloud you&#8217;ll have
the authorities about my ears!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about Mirthrandes Hendershot?&#8221; asked Cap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>&#8220;No&mdash;no! Not that! Not that! Spavin, ring bone
and blind staggers are things of the past. I dare not undertake
to cure any more horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what <i>are</i> you doing?&#8221; asked Pete, as the former
weather prophet entered and took a low stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now we are coming to it,&#8221; was the answer with a
smile. &#8220;In the first place my name&mdash;how does Tithonus
Somnus strike you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An odd combination,&#8221; remarked Cap, recalling the one
ancient god who was turned into a grasshopper, and the
other who symbolized sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odd, and so much the better,&#8221; went on Mr. Somnus.
&#8220;It typifies my calling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which might be&mdash;?&#8221; asked Bill suggestively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which might be almost anything, and nothing, and
which, at times is neither or both, but which at present is
that of astronomer ordinary. That is my present occupation.
I go about the country initiating the farmers and
country folk into the mysteries of the heavens. In fact I
jump about from place to place, hence the name Tithonus.
I jump while others sleep, and show the stars which only
come out at slumber-time&mdash;hence the name, Somnus. Is
it clear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly so,&#8221; answered Whistle-Breeches, who thought
the astronomer a most delightful character.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you are showing the stars and moon?&#8221; asked
Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;On all except cloudy nights,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I find
it pays well. Only misfortune seems to follow me. The
other night when there was a most delightful moon, I had
trained my telescope on it, and was admitting the populace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to the view at so much per &#8216;pop&#8217; as it were. I could not
understand the murmurs of indignation that arose from
some of the gazers, nor the expressions of wonder from
others, until taking a look myself, I saw a strange and
weird countenance peering at me from the end of the telescope.
I had been describing the mountains of the moon,
but lo! they turned out to be the whiskers and eyes of my
pet cat Scratch, who, perched upon the roof of my wagon,
was calmly gazing down through the object lens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cat!&#8221; cried Cap. &#8220;No wonder the people couldn&#8217;t
understand what they saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so I was in ill-repute,&#8221; continued the astronomer
gloomily, &#8220;and had to travel on. Then it was cloudy to-night
so I can do no trade. But enough of this, tell me
of yourselves,&#8221; which the boys proceeded to do.</p>

<p>The talk worked around to Bill&#8217;s misfortune, and as soon
as this topic was reached Professor Clatter, who had hitherto
been talking but little, evidenced a sudden interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it is my turn to say something,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
asked you boys to come here for a purpose, and the purpose
was connected with my friend Duodecimo&mdash;I beg your
pardon, Tithonus Somnus. In the first place, Tithy, which
I will call you for short, in the first place, Tithy, have you
forgotten what you used to know about spectacles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spectacles? No,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;But what in the
world has that to do with baseball, and the fact that Bill
will have to give up pitching?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get to that in time,&#8221; replied the professor. &#8220;You
used to go about the country fitting people with glasses,
did you not, Tithy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, until they passed a law requiring one to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
a fixed residence if he would practice as an oculist,
and then I became a weather prophet, a rain-maker, a horse
doctor and other professional men in turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;And am I right in
thinking that you still have your eye-testing apparatus with
you, and also some of the spectacle lens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are. In fact I have made a small telescope of
some of my glasses. You may not think so,&#8221; he went on,
turning to the lads, &#8220;but I received a fine medical education,
and I specialized in eyes. I was once considered a
good oculist, but love of a roving life precluded me practicing
with success. Still I have not forgotten my knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought not!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Clatter with energy.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I asked the boys to come here to-night to
meet you. I had a plan in mind, and I hope, with your
aid, Tithy, to carry it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, here, wants to pitch on the Varsity nine. He has
a good chance, or, rather he had a good chance, until his
unfortunate injury lost him a certain necessary control of
the ball. Am I not right?&#8221; he asked, appealing to the
youth in question.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; answered Bill, wondering what was going
to happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well then. Now it seems that with the proper
glasses the temporary defect in your vision would be corrected
as far as reading was concerned; wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the doctor said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct again. Now then, if you can wear glasses to
read with, why can&#8217;t you wear them to play ball with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play ball in glasses!&#8221; cried Bill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>&#8220;It has been done,&#8221; went on the professor easily. &#8220;Of
course it would be rather hard for a catcher or a baseman
to wear them, with the necessity of having to catch balls
thrown with great swiftness. But it&#8217;s different with a
pitcher. He practically only throws the ball, and it is
returned to him easily. Glasses would not be a hindrance
to you. In fact, in your case, they would be a help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I never thought of wearing glasses and pitching,&#8221;
stammered Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the more reason for thinking of it now. Here is
my plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor motioned for the boys and the astronomer
to give close attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get Tithy here to give you a good examination,&#8221;
said Mr. Clatter, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll have him make you a special
pair of glasses. He&#8217;ll put them in a strong frame, so they
will set close to your face, and fasten on securely. They
won&#8217;t come off no matter how hard you run, and in fact
you may not need them when you&#8217;re at the bat. But you
do need them to pitch with, and you&#8217;re going to have them.
Can you make an examination to-night, Tithy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than in daylight. I have all the instruments,
and I think I could make the glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s all settled!&#8221; declared Mr. Clatter, as if that
was all there was to it. &#8220;Come along, boys, we&#8217;ll go over
to the other palace car, and see what happens. Bill, you&#8217;re
going to pitch again, and if you don&#8217;t make the Varsity
it&#8217;s your own fault!&#8221;</p>

<p>The medicine man had rattled on at such a rate that the
boys had hardly had a chance to speak. As for Bill his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
brain was in a whirl. He did not know whether or not to
have any faith in what was proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think it can be done?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it can!&#8221; declared Mr. Clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make the glasses all right,&#8221; answered Mr. Somnus
with professional pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;But could I pitch with them on?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why not,&#8221; was Cap&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t the fellows laugh me off the diamond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see them do it!&#8221; exclaimed Whistle-Breeches
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t play, after you show that you can still
pitch as good as before, Cap and I won&#8217;t be on the team,&#8221;
declared Pete with energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not going to act that way about it,&#8221; spoke
Bill, but there was a more hopeful look on his face.</p>

<p>A little later he was again being put through the eyesight
test. Mr. Somnus, as he preferred to be called, was
in his element. He had a very good set of instruments, and
he very soon demonstrated that he knew his business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Hum!&#8221; he exclaimed from time to time, as he made
test after test, and jotted down the results of some calculations
on paper. &#8220;I find that you will have to have a
very peculiar pair of lens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t them, but
I can get them for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And will the defect in my eyes be corrected?&#8221; asked
Bill eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never know you had it,&#8221; was the confident answer.
&#8220;The injury was a peculiar one, involving, as the
other doctor told you, one of the optic nerves. It may
pass away at any time, but while it exists it must be corrected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Glasses will do it, and inside of a week I predict
that you will pitch as well as before. Shall I make
the glasses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; fairly shouted Bill. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what they
cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The details were soon arranged. Mr. Somnus knew of
an establishment where lens for glasses were ground, and
he undertook to procure them for Bill. He would return
with them in a few days, he said, and adjust them in a
proper frame&mdash;a frame that would admit of rough play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll see what happens,&#8221; said Professor Clatter.
&#8220;I have to travel on in the morning, but I&#8217;m coming back
to see the test. I&#8217;m interested in this,&#8221; and the honest, if
somewhat eccentric character, clapped Bill heartily on the
back.</p>

<p>The pitcher&#8217;s spirits had come back to him, and on the
way back to the school that night he laughed and joked
with his brothers as before.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the time would never pass. Baseball
practice was the order of the day now, and every afternoon
the Westfield diamond was thronged with prospective members
of the Varsity nine. Cap was more than ever assured
of a place as catcher, Pete, as I have said, was the regular
Shortstop, but poor Bill had to wait, and see his rival,
Mersfeld, filling the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;But keep up your spunk,&#8221; Pete told his brother one
afternoon, following a grueling practice. &#8220;They&#8217;re not half
satisfied with Mersfeld, and if your glasses are any good at
all you&#8217;ll have his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to put him out,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;If I only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
get a chance to play in some of the big games I&#8217;ll be satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>He refrained from pitching during the time he was
waiting, and was excused from some of his studies until
he had the reading glasses the town oculist made for him.</p>

<p>Then, one day, came a note from the rain-maker stating
that he and his wagon were in their former place, and that
the &#8220;ball-glasses,&#8221; as Bill called them, were ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the test!&#8221; cried Mr. Somnus, as Bill, his
brothers and Whistle-Breeches arrived at the improvised
camp early one afternoon. Cap had brought his mask and
glove and was to catch for his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope my plan works,&#8221; murmured Mr. Clatter.</p>

<p>The special lenses which Mr. Somnus had had made were
fitted into a strong, black rubber frame, and it set close to
Bill&#8217;s eyes. It gave him an odd appearance, but it was
just the thing for playing a game of ball. He had demonstrated
that he could bat well without any glasses, so he
would only have to be a &#8220;four-eyes,&#8221; as he dubbed himself,
in the pitching box.</p>

<p>The glasses were put on. Bill took a ball, and walked
off a short distance while Cap donned his mask and mitt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her go!&#8221; he called to his brother, who was &#8220;winding
up,&#8221; in his usual fashion. A square stone had been laid
down as a plate.</p>

<p>There was an anxious moment among the little knot of
spectators. Bill drew back his hand, worked his arm a
couple of times, squinted through the glasses, and then
with the speed of a miniature projectile, the ball left his
grip and sped toward Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Biff!&#8221; That was the ball hitting the big mitt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>&#8220;Strike!&#8221; yelled Cap. &#8220;It was over the plate as clean
as a whistle, but it had a curve to it that would fool Hans
Wagner himself! Good work, old man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try another!&#8221; called Bill, trying to keep his voice cool.</p>

<p>Once more the ball went over the plate cleanly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike!&#8221; called Cap again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they all right?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right as a trivet! Oh, Bill, you&#8217;re yourself again!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moisture in the pitcher&#8217;s eyes, but the odd
glasses concealed his tears of gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; yelled Professor Clatter leaping about like
a boy. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ll make the Varsity; eh Tithy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will! I can read it in the stars!&#8221; said the little
astronomer, gaily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE TRY-OUT</p>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Bill was delighted to find his former skill had not
deserted him goes without saying. It was tempered a bit
by the fact that he had to wear glasses, but that could not
be helped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how Mr. Windam will take to &#8217;em?&#8221; he asked
his brothers as they walked back to school together.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t care as long as you can pitch the way you
did this afternoon,&#8221; declared Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what Graydon will say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he can say anything,&#8221; came from
Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;Any captain wants the best pitcher he
can get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And as for J. Evans Green, he&#8217;s the kind of a manager
who wants to see games won, and keep possession of the
pennant,&#8221; declared Pete. &#8220;There won&#8217;t be any kicking
about the glasses, Bill. He&#8217;d let you wear hoop-skirts if
it made you play better.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was objection to Bill when he appeared for
practice wearing the odd goggles, though it did not come
from coach, captain or manager. It was first voiced by
Bondy Guilder, and some of his cronies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you play a lot of men with crutches, and
their arms in bandages?&#8221; asked the rich youth with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would if they could do better than some fellows I
know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> who seem to think a ball will bat itself and catch itself,&#8221;
declared the captain with energy, for there had been
a slump in practice that day.</p>

<p>It even extended to Mersfeld the crack pitcher who issued
passes to a number of men and was hit more times than he
liked to count.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; demanded the coach half
savagely as the scrub pulled over three runs in succession,
and Mersfeld walked another man to first. &#8220;Are you
dreaming that this is a tennis match, or don&#8217;t you want to
play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I want to play!&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;only I can&#8217;t
be at top-notch all the while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to!&#8221; was the curt decision. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t
do better than this in the final try-out you&#8217;ll be a substitute
instead of a regular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I suppose &#8216;Foureyes&#8217; Smith will have my place?&#8221;
suggested Mersfeld with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll go to the man who does the best work&mdash;four eyes
or eight eyes&mdash;rest assured of that. Now put some ginger
into your pitching, if you can!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stung by the words of the coach Mersfeld did a little
better, and the Varsity saved the game by a narrow margin.
But there were many whispers around the school and in
the gymnasium that day there were strange rumors of a
shake-up in the team, rumors of the strong nines which
the Tuckerton Sandrim and Haydon schools had ready
to put on the diamond to battle for the pennant in the
interscholastic league.</p>

<p>The opening of the season was not far off. Day by day
the practice on the Westfield diamond grew harder and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
exacting. Bill had gotten back all his former skill, and
the little rest seemed to have done him good, for his speed
increased, and his curving ability was considered remarkable
by his friends. He had gotten used to the glasses
which he only wore when in the box, and he hardly noticed
them at all.</p>

<p>Mersfeld, too, had taken a brace, and was doing good
work, whereat coach and captain were glad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;ll make out,&#8221; said Graydon one night when
he and Mr. Windam were talking over matters. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
glad we have Smith to fall back on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I. Smith may be first pitcher yet. When have
you arranged for the try-out game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Day after to-morrow. We&#8217;ll play Mersfeld four innings
on the Varsity and then give Smith a show. That will be
the test.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was so much interest in the try-out that almost
as big a crowd assembled on the diamond to witness it
as usually was present at a match game. Bill was a trifle
nervous for he realized what he was up against, and as for
Mersfeld, that pitcher went about with a confident smile on
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to make it?&#8221; his friends asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am,&#8221; he assured them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pitch against
Tuckerton all right Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first league game was to take place then, and
it was unofficially announced that the players who made
the best records in this, the final try-out would have the
honor of representing Westfield on the diamond at the
opening of the season.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play ball!&#8221; called the umpire, and Bill watched his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
rival take his place in the box. How he longed to be
there himself! But he knew his turn would come, and
he felt in his pocket to see if his precious glasses were
safe. Without them he would be lost, and he wished
now that he had had two pairs made for emergencies.
He decided he would try to locate the traveling astronomer
and get another set.</p>

<p>The game opened up with a snap, and this was maintained
right along. Everyone was doing his best, for it
was no small honor that was at stake. There was no
denying that Mersfeld did well for the first three innings.
There was only one hit off him, and in the fourth
he struck out two men in quick succession.</p>

<p>Then, whether it was a slump, whether he went stale,
or whether it was nervousness due to the fact that he was
under close observation did not manifest itself, but the
fact remains that, after getting two men out, he grew
wild, passed one of the poorest batters, was hit for a
three bagger by the next, and when another got up, and
knocked a home run, there was pandemonium among the
members of the scrub nine.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s got into Mersfeld?&#8221; was the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Nobody knew, and when the fifth inning opened, with
Bill in the box, there was intense excitement. Bill adjusted
his glasses and got ready to pitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now watch Foureyes put &#8217;em over!&#8221; sneered Bondy
Guilder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do!&#8221; called Mr. Windam sharply. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t
a match game, and there&#8217;s no need of rattling one of our
own men. Save your sarcasm, Guilder, for Tuckerton!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bondy muttered something under his breath, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
walked over to talk to Mersfeld, who was darkly regarding
his rival from the coaching line.</p>

<p>Bill was a bit nervous but as Cap had been sent in to
catch the pitcher grew confident as he saw the friendly
face of his brother, and caught the well-known signal for
an out shoot.</p>

<p>Bill nodded in confirmation, drew back his arm, hesitated
a moment, wondered for one wild second whether
he was still himself, and could see to make the curve, and
then&mdash;he threw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike one!&#8221; howled the umpire, and then Bill knew
that he <i>was</i> himself, and a fierce joy welled up in his
heart. He caught the ball Cap tossed back to him, and
sent it stinging in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike two!&#8221; was the reassuring call, and the batter
pounded the plate in desperation, for he had not before
moved his stick.</p>

<p>He swung viciously at the next one, and&mdash;missed it
clean.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go at &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put some more over like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the next one a teaser!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus Bill&#8217;s friends encouraged him.</p>

<p>The try-out game went on, growing more fierce as each
player struggled to make a record. Bill was a marvel
with the ball. But one hit was registered off him during
the five innings that he pitched. After the contest there
was a consultation among the captain, manager and
coach and it was announced to the anxiously waiting
ones that Bill Smith would pitch the first five innings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of the opening game with Tuckerton, with Mersfeld as
second pitcher, while Cap Smith would catch for his
brother, and Dean Denby for Mersfeld.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you that&#8217;s how it would be!&#8221; cried Whistle-Breeches
clapping Bill on the back with such heartiness
that the pitcher&#8217;s glasses nearly flew off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy, I&#8217;m proud of you!&#8221; spoke Cap fervently.</p>

<p>Mersfeld said nothing but there was a bitter feeling
in his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;An upstart Freshman!&#8221; he muttered as he passed by
Bondy Guilder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what,&#8221; agreed the rich youth, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like to
see him taken down a peg. Do you know how it can be
done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the rival pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here and I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; suggested Bondy, and
the two walked across the diamond arm-in-arm, talking
earnestly, and the talk boded no good for Bill Smith.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE CONSPIRATORS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was plenty to talk about that night. The rooms
of the Smith boys were thronged with some old and many
new admirers, for nothing succeeds like success, and now
that Pete was officially named as Varsity shortstop, now
that Bill had the preference, at least in the opening game,
as pitcher, and when Cap was named to catch for his talented
brother our heroes found themselves very much in
the lime-light.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think of all three of us making the Varsity in our
first year!&#8221; exclaimed Bill, as he received the congratulations
of several new acquaintances.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great!&#8221; declared Cap. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid our rivals
will dub it the &#8216;Smith Nine,&#8217; instead of Westfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em,&#8221; declared Captain Graydon, who was present.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what they call the nine if we keep the
league pennant. But let me tell you Smith boys, and
all you other baseball fellows who are here, it&#8217;s going to
be no easy matter. Tuckerton has a battery that&#8217;s hard
to beat, and Haydon has a better team than ever before.
We&#8217;ve got our work cut out for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll make good!&#8221; exclaimed Whistle-Breeches,
who was happy because he had been promised at least
part of the opening game, even though he was in centre
field.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>But among the visitors to the rooms of our heroes
Mersfeld and Bondy were conspicuous by their absence.
The failure of Mersfeld to call was commented on, and it
was openly said that he was jealous. And as Westfield
was an institution where the school spirit was especially
strong this was all the more marked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry there&#8217;s a feeling between the two pitchers,&#8221;
said Captain Graydon to Mr. Windam as they walked to
their dormitories together after the informal little visit.
&#8220;For both Smith and Mersfeld are fine fellows. We may
need them both before the season is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect we will. But we couldn&#8217;t pass over Mersfeld&#8217;s
poor work to-day. By putting Smith ahead of him
it may spur him up a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it doesn&#8217;t spur him up to any mischief,&#8221; murmured
the captain dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mischief; how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he has a very ugly temper, and once he gets
aroused&mdash;well, the worst he can do is to withdraw from
the team, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be sorry for that,&#8221; went on the coach. &#8220;But we
really have a find in Smith. He&#8217;s better than before his
injury, or else those glasses help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s the glasses. No one&#8217;s vision is perfect the
doctors say, and perhaps we&#8217;d all be better for spectacles.
I was just thinking what would happen if they became
broken in a critical game. Bill couldn&#8217;t pitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. He ought to have a pair in reserve. I&#8217;ll
speak to him about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the coach and captain fell to talking about other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
baseball matters, including the coming game on Saturday,
and the chances for winning.</p>

<p>Bill and his brothers rejoiced among themselves, and
with their friends, and a letter telling about the honor
that had come to the Smith boys was sent to their father,
all three joining in making it a sort of composite epistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two days more and we&#8217;ll see what we can do on the
diamond in a league game,&#8221; said Cap, as he got ready to
do some neglected studying. &#8220;Now don&#8217;t mention ball
again for an hour. I nearly slumped in Latin to-day,
and if any of us fall behind we&#8217;ll be hauled up and put
out even if we knock a home run. So buckle down,
fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard work to apply oneself to lessons after the
events of the day, but they did it&mdash;somehow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, strolling along a dark and infrequented
road that led back of the school buildings, were two figures
deep in conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too risky a game to play,&#8221; objected Mersfeld, as
he strode moodily along.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t want him to knock you out of your
place, do you?&#8221; demanded his companion, Bondy Guilder.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not. But suppose I&#8217;m found out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be. I can get the glasses easily enough,
for his room is right next to mine. I was going to change,
for I don&#8217;t fancy the crowd he and his brothers trail in
with&mdash;they&#8217;re regular clod-hoppers. I&#8217;m glad now I
didn&#8217;t, for it will give us just the chance we want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have <i>you</i> got against him?&#8221; asked the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a regular muff, and he thinks he&#8217;s as good as
I am,&#8221; was the illogical answer. &#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
off the nine. It ought to be composed of more representative
school fellows, anyhow than a lot of &#8216;Smiths.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything against the name, but I have
against Bill,&#8221; said Mersfeld. &#8220;He shoved himself in,
and pushed me out&mdash;and I&#8217;d like to get even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can, I tell you. If I get hold of his glasses he
can&#8217;t pitch in the game Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t he get another pair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the way I&#8217;ll work it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Suppose you do manage to sneak in his
room and get his goggles. He&#8217;ll miss them sure as fate,
and send for another pair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No he won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I won&#8217;t take them until Saturday morning,
or just before the game, and it will be too late to get
another pair. Or, better still, I can take out the special
lenses that are in the frames, and substitute others. Then
he won&#8217;t suspect anything, he&#8217;ll go to the box, pitch so
rotten that Graydon will have to take him out, and you&#8217;ll
go in. Bill won&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s the glasses, or
whether his eyes have gone back on him again. How&#8217;s that
for a trick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right I guess,&#8221; was the hesitating answer. &#8220;I
rather hate to be a party to it,&#8221; went on the pitcher, who
was not a bad chap at heart. &#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he had no right to come here and supplant you,&#8221;
put in Bondy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s right. Well, can you get the glasses
from his room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and I&#8217;ll arrange to have other lenses to slip in
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> I&#8217;ll get the size, and they&#8217;re easy to change. I
was close to him to-day, and I saw how the rubber frames
were made. I guess Bill won&#8217;t be such a wonderful pitcher
when I get through with him,&#8221; and Bondy chuckled as
he and his fellow conspirator turned around and walked
back toward school.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">CAUGHT</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was an air of subdued excitement all about
Westfield, that extended even to good old Dr. Burton.
He even found it rather difficult to apply himself to translating
some early Assyrian tablets into modern Hebrew
as a preliminary to rendering them into ancient Chinese.</p>

<p>The various members of the faculty found their students
paying rather less than the usual attention to the
lectures, and in one quiz, when Cap Smith was asked
concerning the raising of an unknown quantity to the
nth power his answer was:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s out on first!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless true, but unfortunately Westfield has no
chair for the science of applied baseball,&#8221; answered the
professor as the laugh went rippling around the room.</p>

<p>But the spirit of the game was in the air, it hung
about the school buildings, lingered in the dormitories,
and the very smell of chemicals in the laboratory seemed
replaced by the odor of crushed green grass, the whiff of
leather and the sound of the explosions of the miniature
Prince Rupert&#8217;s drops, as the science teacher demonstrated
the effect of a sudden change in the strain of a congealed
body seemed to the lads to be the blows of the bat on a
ball.</p>

<p>Over on the diamond, which had been as carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
groomed as a horse before he is led out to try for the blue
ribbon, were any number of eager enthusiasts practicing.
There were talks between the coach and captain, anxious
conferences with the manager, and on every side could be
seen lads in their uniforms carefully looking after balls,
bats, masks or chest protectors. Some were tightening the
laces of their shoes, others mending ripped gloves, while
Bill Smith had indulged in the luxury of a new toe plate.</p>

<p>For the next day would mark the opening of the Interscholastic
league, and the first big game&mdash;that with
Tuckerton&mdash;was to be played.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;And you must wake and call me early,</div>
<div class="verse">Call me early, Peetie dear,</div>
<div class="verse">For to-morrow is the opening</div>
<div class="verse">Of the dear old baseball year.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Cap misquoted the verse, and joined his brothers
and chums in the laugh that followed.</p>

<p>But if there were many hearts that rejoiced at the near
prospect of the big opening contest, there were two lads
whose souls were filled with bitterness. One was Mersfeld,
the partially deposed pitcher, and the other Bondy
Guilder, who, for no particular reason, had come to almost
hate Bill and his brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can get the glasses?&#8221; asked Mersfeld
of his crony, on the night before the big game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ve been watching Bill&mdash;his room&#8217;s next to
mine you know&mdash;and I know just how he goes and comes.
I have some ordinary lenses all ready to slip in the place
of the special ones I&#8217;m going to take out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you get the right size?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I made a pretence of wanting to see his glasses
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> while I had them I pressed a sheet of paper on them,
got an impression of the size, and got the lenses in town.
They are not an unusual size, only they&#8217;re ground differently
to bring one eye in focus with the other. Bill
won&#8217;t pitch more than one inning in the game to-morrow,
and then you can go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s wrong as soon as he has his
eyes, and the glasses tested again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it? He won&#8217;t suspect us, and all you want
is a chance to make good; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for if I do make good in the opening game I&#8217;m
sure they&#8217;ll have to let me stay through the season, and
Bill won&#8217;t be in it. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re helping me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do more than that to put one over on the Smith
boys. I don&#8217;t like them. I wish they&#8217;d get out of
Westfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bondy had his plans all laid, and had, after considerable
trouble secured a pair of lenses to replace those in
Bill&#8217;s pitching glasses. Now, like some spider watching
for his hapless prey, he sat in his room on the morning of
the day of the big game, waiting for a chance to sneak
in and make the substitution. He felt that he could do it,
for no one ever locked his door at Westfield, and Bill had
been in the habit lately of spending a lot of time in the
apartment of Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>But now Bill was in his room, and Bondy was impatiently
waiting for him to go out. The sneak knew that if
he could change the glasses the trick would not be discovered
until after Bill was in the box, for he did not use
the goggles in preliminary practice where there was no
home plate over which to throw.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>&#8220;Hang it all! Why doesn&#8217;t he go?&#8221; thought the rich
lad as he peered from the partly-opened door of his study,
and saw Bill moving about in his room. The pitcher
was taking a few stitches in his jacket, which had been
ripped. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t much more time,&#8221; mused the conspirator,
&#8220;for they&#8217;ll soon go out to practice, and he&#8217;ll take
the goggles with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a call from down the corridor. It came
from the room of Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say Bill, where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here. What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us a hand, will you? I can&#8217;t get this needle
threaded and there&#8217;s a hole in my stocking as big as your
fist. I wouldn&#8217;t mind, only it&#8217;s opening game and we
want to look decent. I caught it on a nail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. I&#8217;ll be with you,&#8221; sung out Bill, and
dropping his own work he darted for the room of his
chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just my chance!&#8221; whispered Bondy. &#8220;But I haven&#8217;t
much time!&#8221; He had the substitute lenses ready, and a
small screw driver with which to open the frame and
make the change.</p>

<p>Into Bill&#8217;s room the sneak darted when he saw the
pitcher enter the study of Whistle-Breeches. A rapid
glance around showed him where the goggles were&mdash;in
their usual place on top of a shelf of books.</p>

<p>It was the work of a minute to secure them, and begin
to loosen the screws. Bondy worked feverishly, but his
very haste and nervousness were against him. His hands
trembled, and he was in a sweat of fear. One glass was
almost loose, when, with a suddenness that was as startling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
as a clap of thunder would have been, the door leading
from Bill&#8217;s to Pete&#8217;s room opened, and the shortstop
entered. He did not notice Bondy at first, as the latter
stood in the shadow of the book shelves, and this fact
gave the conspirator time to shove the screw driver and
extra lenses into his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caught!&#8221; he murmured under his breath.</p>

<p>The tinkle of glass caught Pete&#8217;s ears, and he wheeled
around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Hello, Bondy!&#8221; he exclaimed, and then catching
sight of his brother&#8217;s goggles in the other&#8217;s hands he
quickly asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing with those glasses?&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">BILL&#8217;S PITCHING</p>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Bondy did not answer. On his face
there was a sickly grin, and he seemed to turn a sort of
greenish white.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing with those glasses?&#8221; repeated
Pete as he took a step forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;I just came in to see Bill,&#8221; stammered the rich
lad. &#8220;He was out, and I&mdash;I&mdash;er I was looking at them.
Queer lenses; aren&#8217;t they? One seems to be loose. I was
going to tell Bill he ought to tighten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>No wonder it was loose, for the sneak had partly taken
out the screw. The expression on Pete&#8217;s face changed.
He had had a quick suspicion that all was not right, but
he began to feel now that perhaps he was mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, here is the loose glass!&#8221; went on Bondy eagerly,
for he was quick to notice the altered expression on the
other&#8217;s countenance. &#8220;It ought to be tightened, or it
might drop out during the game, and become broken.
You can tighten it with a knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dared not offer his own screw driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; it does need fixing,&#8221; admitted Pete.
&#8220;Much obliged for noticing it, old man. Bill might not
have seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I just came in&mdash;er&mdash;to ask Bill how his arm
was, and I noticed the glasses,&#8221; went on the visitor lamely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter with his arm?&#8221; asked Pete
quickly, and in some alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, I&mdash;I just wondered if it would hold out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess it will. There, the glass is tight now,&#8221;
and Pete, who had used his knife to set the screw, tapped
the rubber frame to listen for any vibration. There was
none.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221; announced Guilder, with an air
of relief. &#8220;See you at the game. It&#8217;s most time to start,&#8221;
and he slipped from the room, just before Bill returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what he wanted?&#8221; mused Pete, looking after
the retreating figure of the rich lad. &#8220;Mighty funny his
getting friendly all of a sudden. I wonder what he
wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pete looked at his brother&#8217;s glasses. He glanced toward
Bondy&#8217;s room, and pondered again. Just then Bill came
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, son, you ought to keep these locked up,&#8221; remarked
Pete, handing the glasses to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might get broken if you leave them around so
promiscuous. I just tightened a screw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. Crimps! but I&#8217;ve got to hustle. I was
showing Whistle-Breeches how to mend a rip in his stocking.
He was for tying a string around it as if it was a
bag he was closing up. Well, we&#8217;ll soon be slaughtering&mdash;or
slaughtered; eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, how about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fit as a fiddle. I wish I had to pitch the whole game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you won&#8217;t after you see the way they knock
you out. They&#8217;ve got some hard hitters.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying. Is Cap on the job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re all ready. What are you waiting for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just got to put a few more stitches in this jacket.
I&#8217;ll be right over. Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll wait for you,&#8221; and Pete took a chair in his
brother&#8217;s room. He was thinking of Bondy&#8217;s visit but he
made up his mind to say nothing about it at present.
After all he might be wrong in his suspicion, but he resolved
to keep a sharp lookout.</p>

<p>Soon Bill had finished his sewing task, and went out
with his brother. Cap joined them, and a little later
they were on the diamond, indulging in some light practice.</p>

<p>Down the road came the sound of songs and cheers,
mingled with indiscriminate yells. Then came the blast
of horns.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cohorts of Tuckerton!&#8221; cried Cap. &#8220;Here they
come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Several big stages swung into view, laden down with
students and girls, for the boys had brought a lot of their
young lady friends to see the game.</p>

<p>The vehicles were gay with colors&mdash;flags and banners
waved from canes and long staffs. Horns adorned with
the hues of Tuckerton were waved and blown. Then
came more songs, more cheers, more wild yells, and
more rioting of colors, as the banners, flags, ribbons and
streamers were shaken at the crowds of Westfield students
who poured out and greeted their rivals.</p>

<p>As the stage loads of spectators drew up and were
emptied, another carryall swept along the road. It contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the opposing nine, and in grim silence, like gladiators
coming to the battle, they alighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cheers for the best nine in the league!&#8221; called
the leader of the Tuckerton cohorts, and the yells came
in quick response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now three cheers for the second beet nine&mdash;the one
we&#8217;re going to wallop&mdash;Westfield!&#8221; called the same youth
who was almost hidden behind a big bow of his school
colors.</p>

<p>Westfield was appropriately serenaded, and then they
returned the compliment. The grand stands and bleachers
were now beginning to fill, for a game of baseball
between these two schools was worth coming a long distance
to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! what a lot of pretty girls!&#8221; exclaimed Pete as
he stood with his brothers near home plate after some
sharp warm-up practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You let the girls alone&mdash;until after the game,&#8221; advised
Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;There <i>is</i> a big crowd,&#8221; remarked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it fuss you,&#8221; suggested his older brother, for
Bill was likely to get a bit nervous, and he had never
played in such a big and important game before. &#8220;Come
over here and we&#8217;ll try a few balls. Better wear your
glasses to get more used to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! maybe it&#8217;s a good thing I got caught as I did,&#8221;
mused Bondy as he saw Bill putting on the goggles before
the game had started, as he was practicing with Cap.
&#8220;He&#8217;d have found it out by now, and the game would have
been all up. But I&#8217;ll get him yet! I wonder why Mersfeld
doesn&#8217;t come around. He acts afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>The other pitcher was afraid&mdash;horribly so. His heart
misgave him for consenting to the trick, and yet he let
it be carried out. At least he supposed it had been, for
he took pains to keep out of the way of Bondy. And
when he saw Bill in the goggles pitching a few preliminary
balls to his brother, he wondered what sort of balls they
were.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will he last&mdash;how long?&#8221; he murmured, for
he thought the plot had been carried out.</p>

<p>The crowds increased. The Tuckerton nine and substitutes
trotted out for practice, and good snappy practice
it was. Captain Graydon shook his head as he watched.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come pretty near having our numbers,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed the coach. &#8220;They play fast
and snappy, that&#8217;s a fact, but we can do the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s just where our men fall down,&#8221; went on
Graydon. &#8220;They&#8217;re good stickers, and can pull a game
out of the fire in the last few innings, but they don&#8217;t
wake up quickly enough. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m afraid of. I
wish we had decided to let Smith pitch the last half instead
of the first innings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed the
coach. &#8220;This is the first chance I&#8217;ve had to get a line on
the Tuckerton boys, and I believe it will be policy to put
Mersfeld in at the opening. He&#8217;s feeling sore, and he
hasn&#8217;t as good lasting qualities as I&#8217;d like. We&#8217;ll put
him up first, and if he can&#8217;t hold &#8217;em down we can change
at any time. I&#8217;ll tell Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill felt a sense of disappointment that he was not to
open the game, but he knew better than to dispute with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the coach. Cap looked as though he could not quite understand
it, and he wondered if it was a sample of what
would happen in other games.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to save you two for a pinch,&#8221; explained
Graydon to the catcher, just before the game was called.
&#8220;Begin to warm-up again after the third inning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The preliminaries were over, and the Tuckerton men took
their places on the bench, the home team having last chance
at the bat. The Westfield nine walked to the field, and
Bill and Cap took their places with the other substitutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s up?&#8221; mused Mersfeld as he was told
to go to the box. &#8220;He must have the changed glasses and
Mindam and Graydon have seen how punk he is even in
practice. Here&#8217;s where I get my chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>The game began, and the first crack out of the box
netted a two-bagger for the initial hitter of the Tuckerton
nine. Mersfeld smiled a sickly smile as the ball came
back to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; called Denby reassuringly from behind
the bat. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get this fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mersfeld did strike him out, after the man had made
two foul strikes, and, feeling a trifle nervous the twirler
issued walking papers to the next hitter, who had a high
average for stick work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Work for this man,&#8221; signalled the catcher to the
pitcher, but Mersfeld, as he was about to throw was aware
that the first hitter was stealing to third. He shot to
the baseman quickly&mdash;but wildly. It went over his head,
in among a crowd of spectators, and before the ball could
be fielded in the man was home with the first run of the
game, and with only one out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>What a wild burst of songs and cries of gladness came
from the stands where the visitors were! Flags and banners
waved, and the shrill voices of the girls seemed to
mock the Westfield players.</p>

<p>&#8220;Starting in bad,&#8221; murmured Bill to Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, all our fellows are a trifle nervous. I guess
we&#8217;ll make good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mersfeld redeemed himself a few seconds later by striking
out the next man up, and with two down, the last man
knocked a little pop fly. It looked good but Pete got under
it, and had it safely in his hands when the runner was
ten feet from first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now to see what we can do,&#8221; remarked Graydon
as he came in from first with his men eager to get a chance
at the sticks.</p>

<p>They did not do so much, for there was an excellent
battery against them, and one run was all they could tally.
But it tied the score, and gave the home rooters something
to shout for.</p>

<p>Whether it was nervousness or whether his conscience
troubled him was not made known, but Mersfeld seemed
to get worse as the game progressed. His throws to the
basemen were wild, and he practically lost control of the
ball, while his curves broke too late, and the opposing
team readily got on to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve got the pitcher&#8217;s &#8216;Angora&#8217; all right!&#8221;
chanted the visiting rooters, that being the classical term
for &#8220;goat&#8221; or nerve.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I believe they have,&#8221; admitted the coach, when
the fourth inning opened with the score eight to one in
favor of Tuckerton. They had garnered two in the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
frame, three in the third, and a brace in their half
of the fourth. The one lone tally was all Westfield had
when they came to bat in the ending of the fourth, and
though they worked fiercely not a man got over the rubber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith and Smith is the new battery for the Westfield
team!&#8221; announced the umpire as Graydon&#8217;s men went out
to the field at the opening of the fifth. Mersfeld had not
said a word when ordered from the box. He knew he had
been doing poor work, but with a bitter feeling in his
heart he watched to see how Bill would make out with,
as he supposed, the changed glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now watch the celebrated Smith brothers work!&#8221; cried
a Tuckerton wag, as Cap and Bill took their places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and they <i>will</i> work, too!&#8221; murmured Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least if we can&#8217;t get any more runs, I hope we can
keep the score down,&#8221; thought the coach, to whom the
game, thus far was a bitter disappointment. All his
work so far that season seemed to have gone for naught.</p>

<p>Bill was smiling confidently, as he took his place in the
box. The crowd which had not before had a good look
at him, caught sight of the goggles, and instantly there
was a chorus of cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foureyes! Foureyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was what Cap and Pete had feared would happen.
Would it bother their brother?</p>

<p>Bill showed no signs of it. He did not appear to resent
the name, but smiled back at his tormentors in an
easy fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wear these so I can strike out more men!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;ll do,&#8221; murmured the anxious captain on
first base, and the embittered coach took heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Cap and Bill exchanged a few preliminaries, and then
signalled for the batter to take his place. The man up
was a terrific hitter and Bill used all his wiles on him.
First he purposely gave him a ball, and then sent in a
slow teaser which the man did not strike at, but which
the umpire counted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where he fans!&#8221; thought Bill, as he tried an
up shoot. It made good, and the bat passed under it
cleanly. There was a murmur of chagrin from the stick-wielder&#8217;s
fellows and he resolved to knock the cover off
the next ball.</p>

<p>But alas for hopes! Once more he swung wildly&mdash;and
missed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out!&#8221; howled the umpire gleefully, for his sympathy
was with Westfield, as much as he dared show it.</p>

<p>And when the next two men never even touched the
ball there was joy unbounded in the ranks of the home
team, for now they saw a chance for victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that you did anything,&#8221; whispered Mersfeld
to Bondy as the change was made for the ending of
the fifth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t get the chance,&#8221; whispered back the plotter.
&#8220;I was nearly caught. But this isn&#8217;t the only game.
There&#8217;ll be other opportunities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westfield was at the bat, and it must have been the
effect of Bill&#8217;s pitching for every man up made a hit, and
the bases were soon filled. But only two runs came in,
for the opposing team took a brace at an opportune time
for themselves, and in season to prevent too heavy scoring
by the Westfield lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now only six runs to beat &#8217;em!&#8221; called Captain Graydon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
cheerfully, as though that was a mere trifle. &#8220;Keep
up the good work, Bill, and we&#8217;ll dedicate a chapel window
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill did. He surpassed even his own previous pitching
records, and did not allow a hit in that inning, while in
their half of it Westfield got one, making the score four
to eight in their opponents&#8217; favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the lucky seventh!&#8221; called the coach, when
that inning started. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let them get a run, Bill, and
help our fellows to pull in about a dozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill smiled, and&mdash;struck out the first two men. Then
one of the heavy hitters managed to get under a neat little
up shoot, and sent it far out over the left fielder&#8217;s head.
It was good for two bags, and the next man brought the
runner in, to the anguish of Bill, who feared he was
slumping, as there had been two hits off him in succession.
But with a gritting of his teeth he held his nerves in check,
and that ended the scoring for the first half of the
seventh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, eat &#8217;em up!&#8221; pleaded coach and captain
as Bill and his teammates came in. They did, to the extent
of three runs, which seemed wonderful in view of
what had previously been done, and there was a chance for
wild yelling and cheering on the part of the home rooters.</p>

<p>With the score seven to nine, when the eighth opened,
it looked better for Westfield&#8217;s chances, and when she
further sweetened her tallies with another run, brought
in by Pete, there was more joyful rioting.</p>

<p>&#8220;They mustn&#8217;t get another mark!&#8221; stipulated the captain
when the final inning opened. &#8220;Not a run, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I can help it!&#8221; the pitcher promised. From a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
corner Mersfeld watched his successful rival&mdash;watched him
with envious eyes.</p>

<p>From the grandstand Bondy also watched, and muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t fail next time. I&#8217;ll spoil your record if it&#8217;s
possible!&#8221;</p>

<p>Amid a wild chorus of songs and school cries Bill faced
his next opponent. He proved an easy victim, as did the
lad following, but from the manner in which the third
man began hitting fouls it seemed to argue that he would
eventually make a hit. And a hit at this stage might
mean anything. For Westfield needed two runs to beat,
and they were going to be hard enough to secure&mdash;every
member of the team knew that.</p>

<p>It was the fourth foul the batter had knocked. The
others had been impossible to get, though Cap had tried
for them. Now, as he tossed off his mask, and stared
wildly up into the air to gage the ball he heard cries of:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get it! Can&#8217;t get it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to!&#8221; he thought fiercely. He ran for it,
and was aware that he would have to almost run into the
grand stand to reach it. The crowd made way for him.
Into the stand he crashed, with a shock that jarred him
considerably, but&mdash;he had the ball in his hands!</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! Wow! Wow!&#8221; cheered the crowd, even some of
the Tuckertons themselves. The side had been retired
without a run, and they cheered Cap&#8217;s fine catch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for our last chance!&#8221; said Captain Graydon when
his men came in. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just <i>got</i> to get two runs. No
tenth inning&mdash;do it in this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; they all agreed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Whistle-Breeches came up first, and when he had fanned
out he went off by himself and thought bitter thoughts.
For he had narrowed the team&#8217;s chances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we may do it yet,&#8221; said the coach kindly
but he hardly believed it.</p>

<p>Graydon made good in a two bagger, and got to third
when Paul Armitage made a magnificent try, but was out
at first. And that was the situation when Cap Smith
came up. There were two out, a man on third, and two
runs were needed. Only a home run it seemed could do
the trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a home run it shall be!&#8221; declared Cap to himself.</p>

<p>But when he missed the first ball, and when, after two
wild throws a strike was called on him, it looked as if the
chances were all gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll walk you!&#8221; shouted some sympathizers, but the
Tuckerton pitcher had no such intentions. He was going
to strike Cap out, he felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whizz!&#8221; went the ball toward the catcher. Cap drew
back his bat, and by some streak of luck managed to get
it under squarely. He put all the force of his broad
shoulders into the blow, and when he saw the ball sailing
far and low, he knew it would go over the centre fielder&#8217;s
head and into the deep grass beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a home run or a broken leg!&#8221; murmured Cap, as
he dashed away toward first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you Cap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty! Pretty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lalapalooza!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Run!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>&#8220;Keep on going!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on in, Graydon! Come home! Come home!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the frantic cries.</p>

<p>Graydon was speeding in from third, and desperate
fielders were racing after the ball. It could not be located
in the tall grass, and Cap was legging it for all he was
worth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Run! Run!&#8221; Thus they besought him. Graydon
crossed the rubber with the tying run, and still the
ball was not found. Then, as Cap passed second, a shout
announced that a fielder had it. But he was far out, and
the second baseman knew his teammate could never field
it in from where he was. He ran out to intercept the ball,
as Cap was legging it for home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thud!&#8221; The second baseman had the horsehide. He
turned to throw it home, and the catcher spread out his
hands for it. But Cap dropped and slid over the plate
in a cloud of dust, and was safe just a second before the
ball arrived.</p>

<p>Westfield had won! And on the last chance!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A PLOT AGAINST BILL</p>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> rejoicing there was among the members of the
nine and the supporters of the team! How the lads
howled, their hoarse voices mingling with the shrill cries
of the girls! Sober men danced around with their gray-haired
seat-mates, and several &#8220;old grads&#8221; who had witnessed
the contest jumped up and down pounding with
their canes on the grandstand until it seemed as if the
structure would collapse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Cap!&#8221; cried Bill, clapping his brother on
the back. &#8220;Good boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All to the horse radish,&#8221; added Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you fellows didn&#8217;t do so worse yourselves,&#8221; remarked
John, as he tried to fight off a crowd that wanted
to carry him on their shoulders.</p>

<p>He was unsuccessful, and a moment later was hoisted up,
while a shouting, yelling, cheering procession marched
around the grounds, singing some of the old school songs
of triumph. It was a glorious victory.</p>

<p>It was fought all over again in the rooms of the boys
that night, and the team was praised on all sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still it was a narrow squeak,&#8221; declared the coach to
the captain, &#8220;and we&#8217;ve got to do better if we want to
keep the championship.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I guess we&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; answered Graydon. &#8220;Those
Smith boys are a big find.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so! I don&#8217;t know what to do about the
battery, though. We can&#8217;t let Mersfeld and Denby slide
altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll have to play them occasionally. And Mersfeld
isn&#8217;t so bad sometimes. He gets rattled too easily,
and Bill Smith doesn&#8217;t. Well, come on out and I&#8217;ll blow
you to some chocolate soda.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Smith boys were having a jollification
of their own in their rooms, whither many of their friends
had gone. Bill brought out some packages of cakes, and
bottles of ginger ale and other soft stuff, on which the
visitors were regaled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s more power to you!&#8221; toasted Billie Bunce, a
little fat junior, who was not above making friends with
the freshmen.</p>

<p>Mersfeld did not attend the little gathering in the rooms
of our heroes. And had they seen him, in close conversation
with Jonas North, a little later, and had they heard,
what the two were saying, they would not have wondered
at his absence. Mersfeld met North as the latter was
strolling about the campus.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on up there?&#8221; asked North, as he motioned
to where lights gleamed in the rooms of our friends,
for it was not yet locking-up time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Smith Brothers and Company are having some sort
of an improvised blow-out,&#8221; replied the temporarily deposed
pitcher. &#8220;Those fellows make me tired. Just because
they helped pull one game out of the fire they think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
they&#8217;re the whole cheese. I&#8217;d like to get square with Four-eyes
somehow or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; proposed North, with a grin. &#8220;Seems
to me you ought to be able to &#8216;do&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, if it came to a fight, but I wouldn&#8217;t dare mix it
up with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because there&#8217;d be a howl, and everyone would say I
did it because I was jealous. I&#8217;d have to have some
mighty good excuse to warrant wading into him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, can&#8217;t you think of one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;d like to get square with him, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put him out of business you mean&mdash;so he couldn&#8217;t
pitch for a while?&#8221; asked the bully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would do, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might put up a job to burn his hands with acid
in chemistry class some day. Just a little burn would do.
You could say it was an accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s too risky,&#8221; remarked Mersfeld, after thinking
it over. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have it come about naturally.
Now if he or his brothers would try some trick, and get
caught&mdash;suspended by the faculty for a month&mdash;or laid
off from athletics, that would do. But the Smith fellows
seem to have given up pranks lately, and have buckled
down to lessons. I guess they&#8217;re afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>North did not answer for a few moments. He walked
along, apparently deeply thinking. Suddenly he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I have it! Get them caught while doing some
fool cut-up thing, such as is always going on around here.
That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> would do it, if we can get them into something desperate
enough so they&#8217;ll be suspended. Fine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s all very well enough to say &#8216;fine!&#8217; But how
are you going to work it? Haven&#8217;t I told you that they&#8217;ve
cut out jokes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. We can get &#8217;em into the game
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough. All they need is to have some one to
make a suggestion. They&#8217;ll fall into line quickly enough,
and then&mdash;have McNibb catch &#8217;em in the act, and it&#8217;s all
off with their baseball. I haven&#8217;t any love for &#8217;em, either,
and I&#8217;d like to see &#8217;em out of the game. They don&#8217;t belong
in our class here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re all right, but they think they&#8217;re the whole
show,&#8221; complained the pitcher bitterly. &#8220;All I ask is for
Bill Smith to get out of the box, and let me in. I can
do as good as he!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you can,&#8221; agreed North, though if Mersfeld
could have seen the covert sneer in the bully&#8217;s smile perhaps
he would not have been so friendly with him. &#8220;Well,
if you&#8217;ll help, I&#8217;ll work it. We&#8217;ll have &#8217;em caught in
the act&mdash;say painting the Weston statue red or green&mdash;that
ought to fetch &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but how are you going to arrange to have &#8217;em
caught?&#8221; asked Mersfeld.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough. Here&#8217;s my game,&#8221; went on North.
&#8220;First we&#8217;ll propose to Bill or Cap, or to the other brother,
that as things around the school are a little dull, they
ought to be livened up. They&#8217;ll bite at the bait, for they
like fun, and when they hear that it would be a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
stunt to decorate the big bronze statue of old man Weston,
in front of the main building with green or red
paint, they&#8217;ll fall for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they know enough not to get caught, even if
they go into the trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t help being caught the way we&#8217;ll work it,&#8221;
was the crafty reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the night they select for the joke&mdash;and we&#8217;ll
know when it is&mdash;there&#8217;ll be an anonymous letter dropped
at Proctor McNibb&#8217;s door, telling him what is going to be
pulled off. He&#8217;ll get on the job, and catch the Smith
boys at the game. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mersfeld meditated a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it will do,&#8221; he said slowly&mdash;&#8220;only,&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter with my plan?&#8221; demanded
the bully half angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you or I propose such a game to Bill or his brothers
they&#8217;ll smell a rat right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they will, but you don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I&#8217;m such
a ninnie as to propose it ourselves; do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why I&#8217;ll have some one who is friendly to them do
it. Oh, don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;ll fall for it all right enough.
Now come on over to my room, and we&#8217;ll fix it up,&#8221; and
the two cronies, one a rather unwilling participator in the
plot, walked along the campus, casting back a look at the
gaily lighted windows of the apartments of the Smith
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all!&#8221; mused Mersfeld as he tried to quiet an
uneasy conscience, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get those fellows into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
trouble, but I want to be back in my rightful place as
pitcher on the Varsity.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he and North went into the details of the
plot against our heroes, against Bill more particularly, for
it was he whom Mersfeld wanted to displace.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PROFESSOR&#8217;S WARNING</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Say</span>, Cap, don&#8217;t you think things are rather slow, not
to say dreary around here?&#8221; asked Bob Chapin a few
days after the ball game, as he strolled into the elder
Smith lad&#8217;s room, and appropriated the easiest chair.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the spring fever or the summer sleeping sickness
coming on, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up now, Bob?&#8221; asked Bill, as he tossed aside
his chemistry, glad of an excuse to stop studying.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Bob needs is to train for the eleven or get into
a baseball uniform,&#8221; added Pete. &#8220;He&#8217;s getting fat and
lazy, and he hasn&#8217;t any interest in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; cried the visitor, who did not go in for
athletics, and who preferred to be considered a &#8220;Sport,&#8221;
with a capital &#8220;S,&#8221; wearing good clothes and spending all
his spare time in a town billiard parlor. &#8220;You get out,
Pete. Didn&#8217;t I try for the glee club?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you were too lazy to practice,&#8221; remarked Cap
frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How brutal of you!&#8221; cried Chapin, with a mock theatrical
air. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I even forgive my enemies and beg
them to take me into the banjo club?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which, for the good of the service, they refused to
do,&#8221; went on the elder Smith.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, have you no mercy?&#8221; asked the visitor in a high
falsetto voice, striking an attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all out of it&mdash;expect a fresh lot in next week,&#8221;
answered Bill. Then after a pause he added: &#8220;Now
there&#8217;s a thing you could do, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in for theatricals. Why don&#8217;t you join the Paint
and Powder club?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Afraid of spoiling my complexion
with burnt cork and grease preparations, I guess,&#8221; was
the indolent reply. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to discuss myself.
I was asking if you fellows didn&#8217;t find it dull here? Why,
there hasn&#8217;t been a thing pulled off since we brought the
calf into the ancient history class two weeks ago. It
is frightfully dull at Westfield. Don&#8217;t you think so,
really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t noticed it,&#8221; replied Cap. &#8220;What with baseball
practice, and digging and boning and lectures and writing
home occasionally for money we manage to exist; eh
fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; chorused his brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I say it&#8217;s dull,&#8221; went on Chapin. &#8220;Now you
fellows used to cut up some, when you first came, but you&#8217;d
think you had all reformed the way you&#8217;ve been keeping
quiet lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to do,&#8221; complained Bill, in whom the
spirit of mischief burned more strongly than in his
brothers. &#8220;Show us a good lively time and we&#8217;ll be in on
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t show it to you,&#8221; replied Chapin. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
to make it for yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll do my share,&#8221; went on Bill eagerly. &#8220;Why,
is there something up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Bill, you haven&#8217;t any time to undertake any
pranks you know,&#8221; admonished Cap, but his voice was not
at all commanding, and there was a gleam of interest in
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, cut out the funny business,&#8221; added Bill. &#8220;But
what is it, anyhow, Bob? No harm in telling; is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure not. I was just wishing a racket would break
loose, and I happened to think of something a while ago.
It would take some nerve to do it though, and maybe you
fellows&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused significantly&mdash;temptingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, who says we haven&#8217;t got the nerve?&#8221; demanded
Bill quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Bill go easy,&#8221; advised his older brother, but he,
too, looked interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, certainly you have the nerve,&#8221; admitted
Chapin. &#8220;But it&#8217;s risky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you willing to go in on it?&#8221; asked Pete quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; was the instant rejoinder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then name your game!&#8221; came from Bill, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll
find us right behind you up to the muzzle of the cannon.
Out with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish you&#8217;d stayed away,&#8221; spoke Cap. &#8220;I&#8217;m
back in my trigonometry, and if I flunk&mdash;Well, I suppose
we may as well hear what you&#8217;ve got up your sleeve,&#8221; and
he laid aside his book, with a laugh and a half-protesting
shake of his head.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s first act was to go over to the door of Cap&#8217;s room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
in which the gathering took place, and see that the portal
was tightly closed. Then he listened at the keyhole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it perfectly safe?&#8221; he asked in a whisper. &#8220;Can
anyone hear us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what are we up against?&#8221; asked Cap with a
laugh. &#8220;Is this a gunpowder plot, or merely a scheme
to burn the old school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, and I will a tale unfold,&#8221; went on Chapin.
&#8220;Gather &#8217;round, my children, gather &#8217;round the camp-fire
and Anthony shall tell us one of his famous stories. So
they gathered &#8217;round&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, get along with it&mdash;we&#8217;ve got to do some boning to-night,
Bob,&#8221; complained Pete. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard that camp-fire
joke before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the bronze statue of &#8216;Pop&#8217; Weston in
front of the school?&#8221; asked the visitor in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we know it? The statue of the founder of Westfield?
Well I should bust a bat but we do,&#8221; answered
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of the color of it?&#8221; asked Chapin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Cap wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean wouldn&#8217;t it look prettier red or blue or pink,
than the shade it is now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused to look at the three brothers. They did not
answer for a moment. Then Bill exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, is that what you mean&mdash;to paint the statue?&#8221;</p>

<p>Chapin nodded slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;sacrilege,&#8221; whispered Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only an iconoclast would dare think of such a thing,&#8221;
declared Bill. &#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; there was an eager light in his
eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>&#8220;It was done once, years ago,&#8221; proceeded the tempter,
&#8220;and the whole Freshman class was suspended for a week,
as the faculty couldn&#8217;t find out who did it. It has been
many, many, weary years since such an honor fell upon us
Freshmen,&#8221; and he sighed deeply, as though in pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Cap softly. The daring plot
appealed to him, conservative as he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they get the paint off?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;It had to wear off,&#8221; replied Chapin. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t
want to do anything like that. We can use water colors,
and they won&#8217;t spoil the bronze, and really it would
be a little too rotten to make such a mess of it. Just tint
it a light Alice blue, or a dainty Helen pink&mdash;it will wash
off, but it will look pretty for a while, and the freshmen
class will have made a name for itself that it can be
proud of. Are you with me? It can easily be done, and
the chances are we won&#8217;t be caught. How about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; exclaimed Bill quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; began Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come on,&#8221; urged Pete. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time
since we&#8217;ve had any fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re caught, it means good-bye to balls and bats,&#8221;
went on the eldest brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we won&#8217;t be caught,&#8221; declared Chapin eagerly.
&#8220;Besides, what if we are&mdash;that&#8217;s half the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, go ahead,&#8221; agreed Cap. &#8220;Might as well be
killed for a sheep as a lamb, I guess. I&#8217;m in on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now about the paint,&#8221; went on the tempter, as he
again listened at the door. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to be careful
where we get it, as McNibb is a regular detective for following
a clue. It ought to be bought out of town.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, I have it!&#8221; cried Bill, after a moment&#8217;s
thought. &#8220;Professor Clatter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Clatter?&#8221; inquired Chapin. &#8220;You mean
that medicine man with his queer wagon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; went on the pitcher. &#8220;I saw him in town
the other day, and he said he was coming back to play a
return engagement near here. He&#8217;s got some new kind of
stomach dope or something like that. Besides, he has
some patent face powder that he says he got at a bargain,
and he&#8217;s going to try and work it off on the ladies in the
crowd. It&#8217;s a beautiful pink, and it&#8217;s harmless. I was
looking at a box of it, and it got on my hands. Say, for
a few minutes I had the nicest baby complexion you&#8217;d
want to see. But it all washed off as easily as soap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the answer?&#8221; asked Chapin, as Bill
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why we&#8217;ll get some of that powder from the professor,
mix it up, and use it on the statute. It will come off
easily and I defy Proctor McNibb to trace where it came
from. The professor is a friend of ours, and he&#8217;ll keep
mum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; cried the visitor. &#8220;When can you
get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, or next day,&#8221; answered Bill, who had now
entered heart and soul into the piece of mischief. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get enough to give Pop Weston a liberal coating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Night after to-morrow,&#8221; mused Chapin, looking at a
calendar over Cap&#8217;s table. &#8220;That will do. There&#8217;s no
moon. What about brushes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess a whitewash one will do. Maybe the professor
has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> one&mdash;or a big sponge, such as he uses for cleaning
his wagon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried Chapin. &#8220;Oh, I can just see the faculty
when they file past the bronze statue, done to a beautiful
baby pink! Great! No more will the lordly Seniors
boast of having once run a dump cart into the class room.
The Sophs with their little trick of putting tar on the
bell tower will take a back seat, and the Juniors, whose
stronghold, so far, has been the horrible task of burning
red fire under Prexy&#8217;s windows, will be green with envy.
Oh, what a lucky day this has been!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t over yet,&#8221; remarked Cap significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll see Clatter and get the stuff,&#8221; promised Bill.
&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll meet and do the decorating. How many are
in on it?&#8221; asked the pitcher, pausing in his planning.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want too many,&#8221; spoke Chapin cautiously.
&#8220;Us four perhaps, Bondy and Whistle-Breeches if you like,
as they&#8217;re on this corridor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Bondy,&#8221; said Pete quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll let Whistle-Breeches
in, but Guilder isn&#8217;t in our set. He wouldn&#8217;t
come if we asked him, and we&#8217;re not going to. Besides,
he might squeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, five are enough,&#8221; said Chapin. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll depend
on you to get the paint, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fare thee well, then,&#8221; and with another cautious listening
at the door, Chapin took himself out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Cap, of his brothers a little later, when
they had sat in silence pondering over the plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all to the red-pepper,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;We need
something to wake us up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>&#8220;I guess this will prevent dreams for some time,&#8221; observed
the eldest Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a scream of a nightmare when the faculty
sees it,&#8221; came from Pete, &#8220;but there&#8217;s no harm in it as
long as the paint washes off.&#8221;</p>

<p>With many nods and winks Chapin recalled to the three
brothers, and to Whistle-Breeches, next morning the plot
they had made. Whistle-Breeches had been let into it
early in the day, and had eagerly agreed to do his share.
They would need ropes with which to mount to the top of
the big statue, and Anderson had agreed to procure them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can climb, too,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll decorate the top
part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, Whistle-Breeches!&#8221; exclaimed Pete.</p>

<p>It was that same afternoon that Bill saw Bob Chapin
in close conversation with Mersfeld and Jonas North.
It was the first time he had noticed that Chapin was
chummy with the Varsity regular pitcher, and with the
lad who, because of his bullying tactics was generally
shunned, except by his own crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope Bob doesn&#8217;t talk too much about the statue
business,&#8221; reflected Bill. &#8220;Too many cooks make the hash
taste burned. It might leak out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as he was summoned to practice he gave the
matter no more thought until that evening, when he set
off alone to see Professor Clatter, and get the pink paint.</p>

<p>Pete and Cap wanted to accompany him, but Bill declared
that there was safety in small numbers, and that he
preferred to go alone.</p>

<p>He found his old friend getting ready for an evening
performance, filling his gasoline torches, looking over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
stock of supplies, and tuning the banjo with which, and his
not unmelodious voice, he drew a throng about the gaily
painted wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, my young friend, back again!&#8221; cried the professor.
&#8220;Greetings to you. And where are the brothers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Studying, I expect, or making a pretense to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good again! Ah, the lamp of learning burns brightly
when one is young. What ho! Mercurio! Some more
gasoline for this torch! We must have light!&#8221; Then the
professor having ordered about an imaginary slave, proceeded
to fill the torch himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of lamps of learning,&#8221; broke in Bill, thinking
this was a good time to announce his errand, &#8220;we&#8217;re
going to do a little illumination over at Westfield on our
own account. How much of that pink paint have you,
Professor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pink paint&mdash;you mean my Matchless Complexion
Tinting Residuum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s it. We need some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a masked ball?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a bronze statue,&#8221; replied Bill, and he proceeded
to relate the details of the plot. The professor listened
carefully. Bill told everything, and at length the traveling
vendor asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you and your brothers think of this scheme, Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, as a matter of fact Bob Chapin proposed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I suppose he is one of the leading spirits when
it comes to these plots of&mdash;er&mdash;innocent mischief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never knew him to get up anything of the kind
before. And that&#8217;s the funny part of it. He never takes
a hand in &#8217;em. But now he comes to us with the idea,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> he&#8217;s going to help carry it out. I never knew he had
gumption enough to break out this way. It&#8217;s a good one,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And doesn&#8217;t it strike you as odd that he suddenly
breaks out now?&#8221; asked the professor in rather a curious
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odd? Dow do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean do you think he had any object in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Object in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to get you boys interested and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s interested himself. He&#8217;s going to help decorate
Pop Weston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but you say he never did anything of the kind
before,&#8221; objected Mr. Clatter, looking sharply at Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t it rather late in the college year for him to
begin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;say, look here, Professor Clatter! Do you
know anything about this?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only what my common sense tells me. But I
gather that there is some feeling against you because of
baseball matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little&mdash;yes, Mersfeld is sore, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. Now, if some of your enemies could
get you into a game like this, and then desert you, and
let the whole blame fall on you, or, even, we&#8217;ll say, tip
off the college authorities, to use a slang term&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
they make trouble for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they would, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Bob Chapin a particular friend of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>&#8220;Is he in with this Mersfeld?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not any more than&mdash;By Jove!&#8221; Bill checked himself
suddenly. The remembrance of Chapin talking
earnestly to Mersfeld and North came back to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed the professor knowingly, as he rubbed
his hands. &#8220;I fancy we are getting at something. Now
if our friend Tithonus Somnus were here we would get
him to read the stars for us, but, in his absence I&#8217;ll venture
to give you a bit of advice, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Clatter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may consider this in the light of a warning,&#8221;
went on the medicine vendor earnestly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t have anything
to do with the trick of painting the statue, Bill;
or if you do&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if we do?&#8221; repeated Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do, then play the double cross, and catch your
enemies in the net they have spread for you,&#8221; was the reply
in a low voice.</p>

<p>Bill started, and, as he did so there came a cautious
knock at the door of the wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; asked the professor quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me&mdash;Tithonus,&#8221; was the answer in a hoarse whisper.
&#8220;Let me in&mdash;quick! The police are after me!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE PLOTTERS CAUGHT</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Professor Clatter</span> swung wide the door, and the figure
of the rain-maker toppled in, rather than walked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Shut it and lock it!&#8221; he cried, and he assisted
in the operation. Then he passed beyond the small
room in the rear of the wagon&mdash;a room that served as
dining hall, living apartment, sitting room and parlor,
and in a few seconds Mr. Somnus could be heard crawling
into one of the bunks.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they come for me&mdash;you haven&#8217;t seen me, of course,&#8221;
came his voice in muffled tones, indicating that his head
was under the bed clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, my dear Tithy,&#8221; replied the professor.
&#8220;And, in fact, so quick was your passage through, like a
half back making a touchdown, to use a phrase doubtless
familiar to my friend Bill Smith&mdash;to use that phrase, I
have scarcely seen you. But what is the matter? Why
this haste? There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any one following
you&mdash;at least not at your heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; asked the muffled voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, yes, Tithy,&#8221; replied the medicine man, after a
moment of listening. &#8220;No one is coming. But what in
the world is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s an unfortunate mistake I made,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll wait a while, to make sure the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and sheriffs officers are not after me, I&#8217;ll come out and
explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would, Tithy, for Bill and I are much in
the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a wait of several minutes, during which Bill
wondered what in the world could have caused the rain-maker
to flee in such terror, the individual in question
came out of the compartment devoted to the sleeping
bunks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked the professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not well&mdash;bad,&#8221; was the despondent reply. &#8220;You see
I found the star-gazing trade poor lately, on account of
so many cloudy nights, so, in order to make a living I
ventured to proclaim that I would read the stars and reveal
the future&mdash;for a consideration. It was risky, I
know, but I did it, and did it well&mdash;for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;All was prosperous and happy, until to-night, just before
supper I was visited by a man who wanted to know
whether he would be successful in a certain undertaking.
I consulted my charts and said that he would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the undertaking?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was going to collect a long overdue bill from a man
who owed him some money,&#8221; went on the astronomer. &#8220;I
told him to be firm, and he would succeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little later he came back, all tattered and torn, with
one eye blackened, his collar a rag, and his clothes covered
with dirt. He entered my wagon without knocking, and
presented himself before me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was firm!&#8217; he shouted at me, &#8216;but I did not succeed.
This is what the other man did to me!&#8217; Oh, it was
terrible. He accused me of deceiving him, and he sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
at me, and would doubtless have made me suffer, but I
escaped through the front door, leaving my beloved cat,
Scratch, behind, and I fled here.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I ran on I could hear the terrible threats the man
uttered against me, of causing my arrest. Even now I
fear&mdash;hark! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Somnus paused in alarm, and seemed about to dart
for the bunks again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing,&#8221; answered the professor,
calmly. Mr. Somnus listened, and seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that fellow didn&#8217;t mean all he said,&#8221; put in
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; agreed the astronomer, with a sigh. &#8220;I
certainly hope not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not the only one who has troubles,&#8221; went on
the traveling medicine man. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What troubles has he?&#8221; asked Mr. Somnus. &#8220;Has he
been predicting&mdash;reading the stars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; answered the pitcher. And then Professor
Clatter told about the proposed painting of the statue
and his own warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you happened in, Tithy,&#8221; went on the vendor
of the Peerless Permanent Pain Preventative, &#8220;for I&#8217;d like
your opinion about this matter. I say it&#8217;s a plot to get
Bill and his brothers into trouble, what do you think
about it?&#8221; He detailed the reasons for his suspicions,
and waited for an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began the fugitive, &#8220;not speaking by the stars
at all, you understand, and making no promises for which
I can be held responsible, I think you&#8217;re right, Theophilus.
And I&#8217;d advise Bill to look out.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>&#8220;But how?&#8221; eagerly asked the pitcher. &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning
to agree with you. How can I catch Mersfeld and North
at their little game, for a game I think it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough,&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;Go on as if you
and your brothers and Whistle-Breeches&mdash;Oh, what a
classical name&mdash;go on as if you intended to carry out the
trick. Take my word for it those fellows will be hidden
somewhere ready to see you caught, and you can turn
the tables on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;In some way they will, I feel sure, get word to the
college authorities of what is on foot. Very well, you
have but to stay away at the last moment, and give some
sign by which the proctor will be led to the hiding place
of your enemies. Then, by judiciously spilling a little of
the pink paint near their rooms, and secreting a pot of it
near their hiding place, you will have them on the hip, as
my friends the Romans say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Bill, after a moment&#8217;s thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then here is the pink powder,&#8221; went on the professor,
handing Bill several packages, &#8220;and may luck attend you.
Just mix it with water, and it will do the work. Now,
Tithy, I can attend to your case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll get back to school, and put up a game on
North and Mersfeld,&#8221; said Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We wish we could be there to see,&#8221; spoke Mr. Clatter
in eager tones. &#8220;Tithy and I would enjoy it, but we
have troubles of our own. I&#8217;ll be around this way in
about two weeks again, and you can tell me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the ball game,&#8221; invited Bill. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
to play Sandrim in a league contest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>&#8220;I will, if I am not in jail,&#8221; promised the astronomer
solemnly.</p>

<p>Bill hurried back to his brothers and told his story,
adding the professor&#8217;s suspicions, warnings and advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sneaks!&#8221; burst out Cap. &#8220;Mersfeld and North
to put up a game like that on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Chapin to go in with them,&#8221; added Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to be run out of school!&#8221; declared Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; suggested Bill. &#8220;Maybe Bob Chapin didn&#8217;t
know what he was up against. We&#8217;ll have a talk with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob soon proved to the satisfaction of the Smith brothers
and Donald Anderson, that he was not aware of the
&#8220;double cross&#8221; plan of the deposed Varsity pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;North and Mersfeld suggested the scheme to me,&#8221;
Bob admitted, &#8220;and said you fellows would be good ones
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re going to play a safety, and hide somewhere
to watch us be nabbed by McNibb; aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
demanded Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to hide some place near the statue,&#8221;
replied Bob, &#8220;because I heard them saying something
about it. But, honest, fellows, I didn&#8217;t know that they
were going to squeal. They got me all worked up and I
was interested. I hope you believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; Bill assured him. &#8220;Now to get even. I guess,
in case they make the split, that they&#8217;ll send an anonymous
letter to McNibb. How about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; agreed Cap and Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll add another,&#8221; went on Bill, &#8220;and in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
we&#8217;ll disclose the hiding place of the sneaks. Where did
you say it would be, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the clump of rhododendron bushes in front of the
statue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Now the plot thickens, and we&#8217;ll have to
thicken the pink paint. Come on, fellows, get busy.
First I&#8217;ll prepare the second anonymous letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few hours later Proctor McNibb was rather surprised
to receive a screed, signed with no name, informing him
that a plot existed among a certain lot of Freshmen, and
that the said plot consisted of a plan to paint the founder&#8217;s
statue baby-pink.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to catch the vandals, be on hand near the
statue shortly after midnight,&#8221; the anonymous epistle
went on.</p>

<p>Now the proctor was an honorable man, and usually
did not pay much attention to unsigned letters. But here
was one he felt that he must heed. Where it had come
from he did not bother his head about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some upper classmen, who have given over such sacrilegious
horse-play may have sent it,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;or the
townsman from whom the paint was purchased may have
been stricken with remorse, or have a fear that he will
be found out. At any rate I&#8217;ll catch them red-handed.
No, pink-handed I guess,&#8221; and the proctor smiled at his
joke.</p>

<p>The official&#8217;s surprise may be imagined when, shortly
after the receipt of the first letter, he got another. Our
friends had a spy, in the person of one of the janitors,
who did work in that part of the school where Mr.
McNibb had his rooms, and the janitor at once informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Bill when there were signs of unusual activity in the proctor&#8217;s
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s their letter!&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;Now for ours!&#8221; and
it was sent, disclosing the information that the would-be
painters of the statue would be hidden in the clump of
rhododendron bushes.</p>

<p>Then there was a busy time for our friends. Throwing
in his lot with the Smith boys and Whistle-Breeches, Bob
Chapin helped them in the plot, by pretending to keep
Mersfeld and North posted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can hide in the bushes, just as you planned,&#8221; said
the languid youth to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And see the fun?&#8221; eagerly asked Mersfeld. &#8220;Will they
be on hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll be on hand all right,&#8221; said Bob, and there
was a grim smile on his face, which the plotters did not
observe.</p>

<p>So anxious were they to be present, and see the Smith
boys captured, that Mersfeld and North left their rooms
early. This was the cue for Bill and his brothers to make
their way to the enemies&#8217; apartments, and, by scattering
around a little of the pink mixture, give the idea, to a
casual observer, that the coloring stuff had been prepared
there.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, and before the two lads who had
planned to get their classmates in trouble had gone to
their hiding place, several pails of the pink mixture had
been hidden in the clump of bushes. Strings led from the
pails to behind a stone wall, where Bill, his brothers, together
with Whistle-Breeches and Bob, would hide. At
the proper time the strings would be pulled, and the stuff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
upset. This would be additional evidence against the two
plotters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s about time for us to go out,&#8221; said
Cap, as midnight approached, that hour, having been suggested
to Bob by the plotters. &#8220;Go easy, now, for McNibb
may have spotters posted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think not,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;He&#8217;ll depend on catching
us at the statue. Oh, wow! Won&#8217;t those fellows be
surprised!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mersfeld and North were in hiding. They had been
waiting for some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all!&#8221; muttered the deposed Varsity pitcher,
&#8220;why don&#8217;t they come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll be here all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose they could have backed out; do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Bob Chapin said they were hot for the trick, and
rose to it like a hungry trout to a fly. Oh, they&#8217;ll be
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I wish they&#8217;d hurry. I&#8217;m getting a cramp in
my leg, crouching down so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing. I know I&#8217;ll have rheumatism or housemaid&#8217;s
knee, or something like it, for sitting on the damp
ground. But think of it! They&#8217;ll be suspended, and
you&#8217;ll be back on the nine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that makes it worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! I think I hear something!&#8221; cried North suddenly.</p>

<p>They peered out. Two dark figures could be seen coming
cautiously around the base of the statue.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s them!&#8221; whispered Mersfeld.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s McNibb, and one of the janitors is with
him. He&#8217;s too early! He&#8217;ll scare &#8217;em off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove! It looks so. I wonder&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say! He&#8217;s heading this way!&#8221; cried North suddenly.
&#8220;Can he see us?&#8221;</p>

<p>They waited in an agony of fear and apprehension.
There was a movement in the bushes&mdash;a curious sloshing,
splashing sound, and something seemed to be flowing
around the feet of the two plotters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great guns!&#8221; cried Mersfeld, &#8220;what are we up
against?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; begged North hoarsely.</p>

<p>It was too late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! I have you! Waiting for a chance to despoil the
statue; are you?&#8221; cried the voice of the proctor.</p>

<p>He made a rush for the bushes. Mersfeld and North
made a rush to get out. Their feet became entangled in
the strings that had been pulled a moment before by the
hidden Smith boys. Down in the pink paint went the
conspirators, just as the proctor and his impressed aide
hurried up and grabbed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have you!&#8221; exclaimed the college official. &#8220;I have
stopped your nefarious work just in time. Strike a match,
Biddel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The janitor obeyed. In the glow stood two sorry-looking
figures, pink paint dripping from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mersfeld and North!&#8221; ejaculated the proctor. &#8220;I
would not have believed a member of the Varsity nine
capable of such a trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t going to do it,&#8221; began the pitcher, and
then the futility of the denial made itself plain to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
as in the dying glow of the match he saw the sight he
and his companion presented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me, gentlemen,&#8221; said the proctor simply, leading
the way to his quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caught in their own trap!&#8221; whispered Bill softly, as
he and his brothers and chums looked over the top of the
wall, and saw what had taken place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk about painting the town red,&#8221; murmured Cap.
&#8220;The very <i>grass</i> is <i>pink</i>, over there,&#8221; and chuckling to
themselves our heroes hurried to their rooms lest they,
too, be taken in for being out after hours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">AN INTERRUPTED SUPPER</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Wasn&#8217;t</span> it great?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;All to the lalapalooza!&#8221; was Cap&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought sure McNibb would hear us snickering when
we pulled the strings and upset the paint,&#8221; added Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what a sight Mersfeld and North were!&#8221; remarked
Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;They must have looked like
walking complexion advertisements when the lights were
turned on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if they&#8217;ll be fired?&#8221; spoke Bob Chapin. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hu! That&#8217;s probably what they wanted to happen to
us!&#8221; cut in Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;It&#8217;s a case of chicken eat
turkey I reckon, and everybody have cranberries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t actually <i>do</i> anything,&#8221; went on Bill, as
he and his brothers and chums were talking over the affair
next morning. &#8220;The evidence only pointed to them
as if they were <i>going</i> to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough for McNibb,&#8221; commented Cap. &#8220;Great
monkey doodles! There goes last bell and I&#8217;ve got to
look over my Pindar yet. Holy mackerel!&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole school was buzzing with the news, and it
was soon generally known that the Smith boys had neatly
turned the tables on the plotters.</p>

<p>As for those worthies, the events had followed each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
other so rapidly that they hardly knew what to think,
much less say or do. It was a complete surprise to them,
and they dared not utter a word as to what their real
intentions had been.</p>

<p>As Cap had said, the circumstantial evidence was enough
against them. They had been caught, if not exactly with
the paint in their possession, at least with it all over them,
and the anonymous letter was enough to declare their object,
albeit that screed was intended to throw suspicions
on others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you anything to say?&#8221; the proctor had asked
them when he had them in his sanctum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;I guess not,&#8221; answered North, with a glance
at his pink-stained clothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Mersfeld?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, it was not our intention&mdash;Oh, well,
I guess I have nothing to say, either,&#8221; and the pitcher
gave up the attempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You may go. I&#8217;ll take your case up with
the faculty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads were in an agony of apprehension lest
they be expelled, or suspended for the remainder of the
term, but after a faculty meeting, in which Dr. Burton
had made a plea for them, it was decided to debar both
lads from participation in all athletic or other sports for
a month, to stop all evening leave for the same period,
and to inflict other punishment in the matter of doing
extra classical study.</p>

<p>The fact that they had not actually committed any
overt act of sacrilege against the statue was in their favor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
though, as the proctor said, only the receipt of the anonymous
letter prevented it.</p>

<p>And how Mersfeld and his crony writhed in agony as
they thought of the letter they had themselves written!
They guessed that their plot had been laid bare, and they
suspected Bob Chapin, who, fearing punishment, spoke
to the Smith boys about it. Then, on Cap&#8217;s suggestion,
and in order that the truth might be known, a statement
of how it had all come about was drawn up and sent to the
two plotters.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the last time I try any of <i>your</i> tricks,&#8221; said
Mersfeld bitterly to North.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out! Weren&#8217;t you as hot for it as I was? Why
don&#8217;t you think of something yourself then, if you&#8217;re so
smart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will&mdash;next time,&#8221; and the two parted not the best of
friends.</p>

<p>The barring of Mersfeld from the diamond took him
off the Varsity team for the time being, though he was
still considered a member of it, even if he could not play.
He was allowed to take part in practice games, however,
for Captain Graydon and Coach Windam well knew the
value of keeping some box men in reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;No telling when Smith will develop a glass arm or go
up in the air, or get wild,&#8221; said Graydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he&#8217;s doing well now,&#8221; declared the coach.
&#8220;He pitched a no-hit-no-run game in a five inning practice
the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too good to last. We&#8217;ve got to hold on to Mersfeld,
and work up some one else.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>&#8220;Sure. Mighty queer how the Smith boys turned that
statue trick; eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, those fellows aren&#8217;t greenhorns, if they did come
from the country. Wait until they get hold of the ropes
here a little better, and they&#8217;ll cut things loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and maybe they&#8217;ll be barred from the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>But our heroes showed no inclinations, at present, of
doing anything like that. They went on the even tenor of
their ways, showed up regularly at baseball practice, and
had their lessons as well, perhaps, as the average student.
They did not &#8220;cut&#8221; more than the regulation number of
lectures, and they made many friends.</p>

<p>Bill kept on improving in his control and his curve
work, until the delighted coach and captain declared that
they already had a good grip on the pennant.</p>

<p>Several unimportant games were played, and one or
two of the league contests, in which the Westfield nine
made about an even break. The season was far from
over, and he would indeed have been a wise prophet who
could have told who would win the pennant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think even Duodecimo Donaldby, alias Tithonus Somnus
himself would be at a loss,&#8221; declared Cap. &#8220;But,
fellows,&#8221; he went on, addressing his two brothers, &#8220;keep
up the good work. Make the name of &#8216;Smith&#8217; a credit to
the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only trouble is that there are so many Smiths
that in ages to come they won&#8217;t know which breed it was
who did it,&#8221; complained Pete.</p>

<p>Mersfeld was bitter in his heart against our heroes,
and was anxious for revenge, but he and North had had
a falling out, and he did not know what he could do to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
get even with the Smith boys. Meanwhile he sulked in
his room, and thought mean thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, fellows, do you know I think we ought to do
something,&#8221; remarked Bill to his brothers one day, as
they came in tired but happy from the diamond, after
some hard practice. &#8220;It&#8217;s been dull lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s paint another statue,&#8221; remarked Cap grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or put a cow in the physics class,&#8221; suggested Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but seriously, I think it&#8217;s up to us to do something,&#8221;
went on Bill. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a lot of friends who expect
things from us, and we ought to keep up our reputation.
What do you say that we give a little spread? Dad
sent me two fivers the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t give a spread for that,&#8221; declared Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, but you fellows have some, and if you loosen
up a bit&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, count us in,&#8221; came quickly from Pete, &#8220;only how
are you going to do it? Hire a hall in town, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not that kind!&#8221; cried Bill quickly. &#8220;I mean a
little midnight supper up in our rooms. We can do it
fine here, as we&#8217;re on the same floor. It&#8217;s like one big
room when the connecting doors are open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d get caught sure as blazes,&#8221; observed Cap, &#8220;and
you know our reputations are none too good. I think
McNibb suspects us of having something to do with the
statue game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the other day he was up here, snooping around,
and he saw a splash of that pink paint on the wall. He
went over to it right away, and looked at it like Sherlock
Holmes. I was in a nervous sweat, and I thought he&#8217;d
ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> some questions, but he only said: &#8216;Ah, Smith, that
color has a powerful spreading ability; hasn&#8217;t it?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you say?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>could</i> I say? Nothing. I just played safety
and kept still, and mighty glad I was that he didn&#8217;t ask
any more. But as I say, I think he suspects us, so we&#8217;ve
got to be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we can pull this off all right,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;I
have a plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell it,&#8221; begged Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;Things are dull
of late. Liven &#8217;em up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had entered just in time to hear Bill&#8217;s last remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, some big-gun from the other side, England or
Germany, is coming here next Friday night, to lecture on
pedagogics or something like that. The entire faculty is
going, I understand, and only McNibb and the janitors
will be on hand. Besides that, the Seniors have some
sort of a legitimate blow out, and there&#8217;s the Junior concert.
So things will be quiet around here, and we can
just as well as not have our spread. What do you say,
fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m for it&mdash;here&#8217;s my cash,&#8221; answered Pete, passing
over some bills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ditto,&#8221; added Cap, following suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, fellows, I&#8217;m broke,&#8221; put in Bob Chapin, who
looked in at that juncture, &#8220;but if there&#8217;s anything like
that going on, count me in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me too!&#8221; cried Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is strictly on the Smith boys,&#8221; declared Bill.
&#8220;It&#8217;s to celebrate our second childhood, or something like
that. Well, I&#8217;ll go ahead with the arrangements.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>On the Friday night in question there might have been
seen a number of figures&mdash;dark, stealthy figures&mdash;stealing,
one at a time, toward the dormitory where the Smith
boys lived and moved and had their being. Yet not a
gleam of light shone from their windows, for Bill had
bought some black roofing paper and tacked it over the
casements.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes it warm,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it&#8217;s safer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good things had been bought, and some boards to be
covered with newspapers and laid on the beds were to
serve for tables. As the lights were turned off at a certain
hour, save in the corridor, candles had been procured.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last all was in readiness,&#8221; as they say in novels.
The guests had assembled and were gathered about the
banquet table. No one had been caught, as yet, for Bill
had laid his plans well, and all of the faculty, some of
whom might otherwise have been prowling about the
school, were listening to a very deep lecture on how to
impart knowledge to boys, by a man who had never had
any. As for Proctor McNibb, he had so many extra duties
on his hands that he did not go near the Freshmen&#8217;s
dormitory until quite late.</p>

<p>This gave our heroes and their friends the lack of attention
which they much desired. There was a goodly
crowd present, when Whistle-Breeches, who had been
named as toastmaster, arose, and with a bottle of ginger
ale in one hand, and a cheese sandwich in the other,
proposed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Those Smith boys! May we always have &#8217;em with us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221; cried Wendell Borden, in a dull, monotonous
voice. Wendell had read that this was what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Englishmen said at banquets, and his father had come
from England.</p>

<p>&#8220;Less noise!&#8221; ordered Bill. &#8220;Do you want to have the
place pulled, and all of us pinched? Go on and eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>They fell-to, and there was merry feasting, even if the
jests did have to be passed around in whispers, losing
thereby much of their wit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, fellows,&#8221; began Bob Chapin, as he rose and held
out a bottle of lemon soda, &#8220;let me propose&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door&mdash;a knock as of one having
authority.</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell upon the assemblage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer, Bill, Cap&mdash;some of you,&#8221; whispered Whistle-Breeches
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I say?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>The knock was repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask whose there,&#8221; suggested Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who&#8217;s&mdash;there?&#8221; stammered Bill, as though it
cost him an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Mr. McNibb. Are there any persons in your
room besides yourselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;yes,&#8221; stammered Bill. Lying was not permitted
by the school honor code.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door!&#8221; came the command.</p>

<p>Bill looked appealingly around. Some of the boys made
motions as though to dive under the beds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Face the music!&#8221; ordered Cap sharply, for he detested
sneaking tactics.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door,&#8221; came the command again, in stern
tones.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>There was no choice but to obey, and Bill arose to draw
the bolts.</p>

<p>He slowly opened the portal, and, as it swung back the
banqueters peered forward to behold the smiling countenances
of Ward and Merton, two of the biggest seniors
in the school.</p>

<hr class="chap" />



<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">HITTING A BULLY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Blank</span> looks of surprise, astonishment, relief and anger
at the manner in which they had been deceived, struggled
for mastery over the faces of the Freshmen. The two
seniors walked in, looked coolly about, as though the whole
affair had been arranged for their especial entertainment
and inspection, and then calmly took two vacant seats
near the head of the improvised banquet table, which is to
say the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, very cozy and comfortable here; eh Ward?&#8221; observed
Merton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed yes. The old Romans weren&#8217;t in it with these
chaps. They don&#8217;t recline at table, but make their table
on the recline! Ha! Ha! Joke! Everybody laugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a grim silence, at which the Seniors seemed
surprised. They looked around at the banqueters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you laugh?&#8221; demanded Ward. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you Freshies know what&#8217;s good for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Ha!&#8221; burst out Bill, as much in relief at not
finding McNibb in their midst, as at the alleged joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laugh!&#8221; commanded Merton sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laugh!&#8221; ordered Ward sharply.</p>

<p>It was instruction that could not be disobeyed, for the
Freshmen, under certain circumstances, were by the unwritten,
but none the less stringent rules of the school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
bound to do certain things commanded by their class superiors.
Thereupon there ensued a series of snickers, more
or less forced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so loud!&#8221; ordered Merton. &#8220;Or you <i>will</i> have
McNibb here. Sorry if we gave you fellows heart-failure,
but we smelled out this little feed, and thought we&#8217;d
better show you how easy it is to get caught. Pass the
cheese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll have some of those pickled lambs tongues,&#8221;
added Ward. &#8220;I say, boys, you <i>do</i> know how to get up a
grub-fest. Who&#8217;s doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Smith boys,&#8221; murmured Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might have known,&#8221; declared Merton. &#8220;Say, you
fellows are cutting things loose at Westfield. Well, it&#8217;s
good for the old school. Here, Ward, are some prime
macaroons.&#8221;</p>

<p>The seniors helped themselves and each other to what
was best on the table, making more or less funny remarks,
while their unwilling hosts looked on, not daring, because
of another unwritten law, to eat with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, get busy, you fellows,&#8221; ordered Ward. &#8220;Pass
things up toward this end. We&#8217;re hungry, and it isn&#8217;t
often that you have two noble Roman senators to grace
your banquets. Get busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What appetites!&#8221; murmured Cap in whispered admiration.
&#8220;I thought I could eat, but they have me beaten a
mile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, as long as it wasn&#8217;t McNibb. They&#8217;re
welcome to all that&#8217;s left&mdash;we had a good share,&#8221; spoke
Bill.</p>

<p>The Seniors seemed to be having a good time, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
could not keep on eating, and even in their hearts was the
fear lest they be caught. So, with a mock farewell, they
took their departure, promising to send some of their fellows
around to enjoy the feast of good things.</p>

<p>But no more of the fourth-year men arrived, due to the
fact, probably, that the meeting at which were the entire
faculty, was nearly at an end, and soon the college and the
grounds would be infested by professors. Then, too McNibb
might come around at any moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, fellows,&#8221; suggested Bill and his brothers. &#8220;Eat
what&#8217;s left and then cut out of here. It <i>might</i> be McNibb
next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I thought it was all up with us, when that knock
came,&#8221; remarked Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; added Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;Are there
any stuffed olives left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary a one,&#8221; answered Cap. &#8220;Those chaps stuffed
themselves on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuffed Seniors instead of stuffed olives,&#8221; observed Bill
grimly.</p>

<p>The feast was over, the remains cleared away and, one by
one, or in couples, the guests departed, with intervals between
the leavings, so that too much noise might not be
created.</p>

<p>The last one had gone&mdash;the room was in fairly good
shape, albeit bottles and cans had been piled into closets
until the recesses were almost overflowing&mdash;there to stay
until such time as they could be smuggled out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well; how about it?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all right&mdash;even the interruption,&#8221; replied Cap.</p>

<p>There came a sudden knock on the door. The brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
who were not the only occupants of their adjoining rooms
looked at each other with fear in their eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, are you in bed?&#8221; demanded the unmistakable
voice of the proctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;yes!&#8221; exclaimed Bill, making an appealing motion
to his brothers. With a single motion they threw
themselves, dressed as they were, upon the covers, while
Bill extinguished the single candle. &#8220;We&#8217;re in bed, Mr.
McNibb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear it,&#8221; was the grim retort. &#8220;I thought
I saw a light through the key hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no, sir,&#8221; declared Pete. The room was in darkness
but the smell of a recently extinguished candle was only
too evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; and the proctor passed on, leaving the
Smith boys to recover of near-heart-failure as best they
might.</p>

<p>The banquet given by our heroes was the talk of the
school for several days&mdash;wireless talk, of course, for it
would never do to have it come to the ears of those in
authority. Those who had not been favored with an invitation
were wondering how they could cultivate the good
graces of our friends, and the lucky ones who had attended
were wondering when there would be another spread.</p>

<p>There was hard baseball practice the day following the
little affair, and, for some reason Bill was a little off in
his pitching.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll either have to get a new pair of glasses,&#8221; grimly
remarked the coach, &#8220;or you&#8217;ll have to cut out your midnight
suppers, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed the pitcher, for the word of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Windam was law. The scrub, on which Mersfeld was
pitching was close to beating the Varsity, over which fact
the deposed twirler was gloating.</p>

<p>&#8220;If things go on this way,&#8221; he said to his crony North,
as they left the field, the two again being friendly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be back in the box once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to help you,&#8221; was the answer, for though
North did not exactly care for Mersfeld, whom he felt was
not in his &#8220;class,&#8221; yet the bully had formed an unreasoning
hate toward our heroes, and would have been glad to
see them run out of the school. &#8220;If anything turns up by
which we can get back at those fellows, count me in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Mersfeld, duly grateful.</p>

<p>The two strolled across the campus, and, as they got
behind a clump of bushes, North saw a small, timid boy,
one of the students at a preparatory school connected with
Westfield, passing along. He called to the lad, whom he
knew slightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Harvey, carry my glove and bat, I&#8217;m tired,&#8221;
for North had been playing on the scrub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Harvey. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a hurry.
I&mdash;I will next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said now!&#8221; exclaimed North putting out a hand, and
catching the small chap roughly by the shoulder. &#8220;<i>Now</i>,
do you hear! Not next week, but <i>now</i>. What&#8217;s getting
into you fellows from the prep, anyhow? Take that bat!&#8221;
and the bully brought it down with considerable force on
Harvey&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>The little lad gave a cry of pain, and started to run,
breaking from North&#8217;s hold. With a coarse expression
the larger student threw his heavy glove at the little boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
catching him on the back of the head. Then, with a
quick jump North was at his side again, and had the little
fellow&#8217;s arm in a cruel grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to run away from me; will you?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you that it won&#8217;t do to fool with me&mdash;you
prep. kids are getting too fresh. Now you get down on
your knees and beg my pardon, and then take my glove and
bat, and Mersfeld&#8217;s bat too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, North&mdash;&#8221; began the pitcher, who was a fairly decent
chap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me manage him,&#8221; exclaimed the bully. &#8220;These
kids have to be taught their place. Get down on your
bones, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized the frail lad&#8217;s hands in his strong ones, and
bent them over backward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. North! Please don&#8217;t. I&mdash;I won&#8217;t do it
again! I&#8217;ll carry the bat! Oh, you&#8217;re breaking my
hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>He cried out in agony, and Mersfeld took a step forward
half intending to interfere. But he did not get the chance.</p>

<p>Some one with blazing eyes leaped from behind the
clump of bushes and confronted the bully. A clenched fist
was drawn back, and then shot forward. Right on the
point of North&#8217;s aristocratic chin it landed with a sound
that could be heard for some distance.</p>

<p>Backward the bully was hurled, almost turning over, and
then he slumped down on the grass. He stayed there for
several seconds, and then got up slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who did that?&#8221; he asked thickly, for he was a bit
dazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; answered Cap Smith quietly, &#8220;and if you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
any additional just try some more of your bullying tactics
on boys smaller than yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>North staggered to his feet, and rushed at Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here! Not now!&#8221; cried Mersfeld, throwing himself
in front of his crony. &#8220;Meet him later! There&#8217;ll have
to be a fight, of course?&#8221; and the pitcher looked at Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; was the grave answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll see one of your friends,&#8221; for these
matters were rather scientifically arranged at Westfield, on
certain occasions.</p>

<p>&#8220;See Bill or Pete,&#8221; answered Cap, as he turned aside and
strolled up the campus.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE FIGHT</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Time!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the call of the watch-holder, and, as he spoke the
word, two scantily clad figures leaped toward each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him easy now, Cap!&#8221; cautioned Bill to his larger
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in and finish him!&#8221; advised Mersfeld to North, for
whom he was acting as second. Merton was keeping
time, and Ward, the other Senior who had been the unbidden
guest at the little spread was referee.</p>

<p>It was the fight between North and Cap Smith&mdash;the
fight which was the inevitable outcome of the interference
when the bully was mistreating little Harvey.</p>

<p>The contest took place where all such affairs were &#8220;pulled
off,&#8221; if I may use such a term, in a well-secluded spot back
of the baseball grandstand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch his left!&#8221; was the further advice of Bill, who was
acting as second, gave to his brother, while Mersfeld sarcastically
cut in with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for biting in the clinches, North.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a useless insult, for Cap never answered it.</p>

<p>Narrowly he watched his opponent, looking into his eyes,
and trying to guess, by close observations of those organs,
how the lead would be.</p>

<p>Out shot North&#8217;s left, after a weak feint with his right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Cap was not deceived. Cleverly he blocked the blow and
countered with his left. His aim was a bit short, but it
caught North over the eye, too lightly to raise a mark,
however.</p>

<p>The fight was now on, and for a time blows were delivered
with such rapidity that the onlookers were in doubt
as to who was having the best of it. It was give and take,
yet it was not brutal.</p>

<p>For the lads were both healthy and strong, and the soft
gloves which the Seniors had insisted that they wear, precluded
any serious damage to either. Nor were they scientific
enough to do any material harm, for though they had
both taken boxing lessons, they were far from being in the
class with pugilists.</p>

<p>North half turned, made a feint as though to drive his
right into Cap&#8217;s face, quickly shifted, and shot out his left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; cried Mersfeld in anticipation of what was about
to happen to the youth against whom he bore a grudge.</p>

<p>But it was the unexpected which took place, for North
in making the shift had left himself unguarded for one
fatal moment.</p>

<p>In shot the ready left of Cap Smith, straight from the
shoulder, with all the steam behind it which our hero could
muster, and North was neatly bowled over, bleeding slightly
from the nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;First blood for us!&#8221; called Bill shrilly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t shout over it, and bring McNibb
here!&#8221; grumbled Mersfeld, as he hurried to his fallen
champion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m all right!&#8221; gasped North. &#8220;My&mdash;my foot
slipped on the grass.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>&#8220;Like fun!&#8221; retorted Pete. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have some more of
those &#8216;slips&#8217; before it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; spoke Ward quietly. He looked at his
classmate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time,&#8221; called Merton, for North had been attended by
his second, while Bill looked after Cap, who was in no way
distressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry to finish him,&#8221; whispered Bill, as Cap arose
from his knee to go forward. &#8220;You can do him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; was the cautious reply. &#8220;He
has a strong right, and guards pretty well. I just managed
to get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get you that way again,&#8221; advised Mersfeld
to his friend. &#8220;It&#8217;s too risky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were at it again, hammer and tongs, giving and
taking. Several body blows were exchanged, making both
lads grunt, but doing no damage.</p>

<p>Then, when Cap tried for another left to the jaw he
either miscalculated, or North guarded quickly, for Cap&#8217;s
fist came against his opponent&#8217;s forearm, and the next minute
our hero went down under a well directed blow, that
eventually closed his right eye. But he did not mind this,
got up quickly and was at it again.</p>

<p>Seeing his advantage in the next round North hammered
away at Cap&#8217;s optic, thereby not only causing the Smith
lad exquisite pain, but greatly hampering him in the fight,
for his vision was reduced by half.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got him now!&#8221; exulted Mersfeld, when the
round was over, and he was spraying his man with water
from a ginger ale bottle. &#8220;Keep at him!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s got lots of go yet,&#8221; declared North. &#8220;If I
can close his other eye I&#8217;ll have him though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then play for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>North tried to, but he was so intent on this that he left
his own chin unguarded. Cap did not care much about
inflicting visible punishment on the bully, but he did want
to end the fight, for which, truth to tell, he had no great
hankering.</p>

<p>Once more his reliable left went boring in, and North
gently went over backwards, coming heavily down in the
grass. He almost took the count, but the time keeper was
merciful, and allowed him a few seconds.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s about all in,&#8221; whispered Bill to his brother, when
after some feeble and cautious sparring the round was at
an end. &#8220;Finish him up. I&#8217;m afraid McNibb or some of
the profs. might come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I. Here goes for a knock-out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cap tried for it, but North was shifty. He was playing
on the defensive now, for he found that Cap was more
cautious and was guarding his damaged eye well. And
North did not dare open his guard enough to come back
strong. Therefore he clinched several times, hanging
heavily on his opponent to tire him.</p>

<p>Cap tried to avoid this, and there was considerable leg
work which was hard on the breathing apparatus. He
thought he saw one good chance, and sent in an upper cut,
but it fell short, and he got a blow on the ear that made
his head ring.</p>

<p>Thereafter he was more cautious.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do him up soon,&#8221; implored Bill. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you
take a chance?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to, with my bad eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Well, use your own judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the next round was the last, and the end came most
unexpectedly. North led with his right, intending to try
once more his feinting, shifting tactics. But he made a
miscalculation. Cap blocked with his left, and sending in
a cross-counter with his right caught North on the side
of the head.</p>

<p>Down went the bully like a log, not badly hurt, but
stunned enough to make him take the count. There was
no chance to allow the fatal ten seconds to elapse, however,
for, from the crowd that surrounded the two contestants
came the cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes Prexy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Skip! Here&#8217;s Dr. Burton!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Cap! Get into your coat&mdash;never mind your
shirt&mdash;out this way!&#8221; cried Bill, Pete and Whistle-Breeches
in the same breath.</p>

<p>Cap looked afar, and saw the figure of the venerable
president bearing down on them. The head of Westfield
school was eagerly perusing one book, and had another
under his arm.</p>

<p>Cap hurriedly dressed as best he could. He saw North
slowly rising, assisted by his friends. Cap started toward
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you going?&#8221; demanded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;To shake hands&mdash;it&#8217;s all over. I want to be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no time. I doubt if we can get away as it
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill, Pete, Whistle-Breeches and some of the others
tried to get Cap in their midst, so that his blackened eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
would not be seen. They hoped to be able to get back
to their rooms by a round-about path, but, alas for their
hopes. Dr. Burton looked up, saw them, and changing
his course, bore down more directly on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all up!&#8221; groaned Pete.</p>

<p>Bill looked around, and saw North and his friends hurrying
into the dressing rooms under the grandstand. He
wished he had thought of that, but there was no time now.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE KIDNAPPED PITCHER</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">What&#8217;ll</span> you say when he asks you what&#8217;s up?&#8221; asked
Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll have to tell the truth,&#8221; answered Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you say you ran into the fence catching a
foul ball?&#8221; inquired Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; was his brother&#8217;s retort. &#8220;The doctor
would guess right in a minute. Besides, I wouldn&#8217;t fake
it that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. I was only joking. Well, he&#8217;ll be here
in a second. He&#8217;s looking at us as if undecided whether
we were Greek roots or some Sanskrit characters. Maybe
he&#8217;ll pass us up,&#8221; went on Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No such luck!&#8221; groaned Pete. &#8220;Pull your cap down
farther over your eyes, and maybe he won&#8217;t see the bruise.&#8221;</p>

<p>But all the efforts of the lads were seemingly to go
for naught. The venerable president, squinting at them
through his thick spectacles, smiled in a friendly fashion,
as he came nearer. The students halted and touched their
caps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, boys, just coming from a game?&#8221; inquired Dr.
Burton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Whistle-Breeches, who, being
slightly taller than Cap, had stepped in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, and who won, may I ask?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>&#8220;We&mdash;er&mdash;that is we didn&#8217;t finish,&#8221; answered Bill, hoping
to draw attention away from Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;The season has opened well, I hope,&#8221; went on the
doctor. &#8220;And there are good chances for keeping the
pennant here, I trust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to try hard,&#8221; put in Pete, who, being
on the other side, trusted to draw the attention of the
president farther away from his brother. As for that
hero he remained quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull your cap farther down!&#8221; again advised Bill in a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Whether it was that or whether he would have noticed
it anyhow, the eyes of the president went straight to
Cap&#8217;s bruised countenance. He saw the blackened eye,
and the cuts and scratches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there has been an accident, I see,&#8221; he remarked,
and he advanced closer to the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;yes&mdash;that is I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out,&#8221; whispered Bill, nudging his brother in the
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit by a ball, I suppose,&#8221; went on the president.
&#8220;And yet they say baseball is comparatively harmless.
Why, you look almost as if you had been through a football
scrimmage, Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;yes, sir,&#8221; stammered Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better have it attended to right away,&#8221; continued Dr.
Burton. &#8220;That eye looks very painful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; murmured Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you had better wear a stronger mask,&#8221; were the
doctor&#8217;s parting words, as he turned aside. There was
a queer smile on his face, and his eyes twinkled behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
his glasses. He opened his book at the place where a
cautious finger had kept the pages apart, and passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk about luck!&#8221; exclaimed Whistle-Breeches hoarsely.
&#8220;He never even suspected that there&#8217;d been a fight. Oh, you
Cap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suspected!&#8221; burst out Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet he knows all
about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not!&#8221; declared the other lad. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s so
interested in that book that I don&#8217;t believe he remembers
now whether he spoke to us or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t; eh?&#8221; exclaimed Bill. &#8220;Say, he went off
reading his book upside down, and if that doesn&#8217;t indicate
that he&#8217;s on to our game, and is laughing at our attempts
to keep it from him, I&#8217;d like to know what it does mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was his book upside down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know. Say, what the doctor doesn&#8217;t
know wouldn&#8217;t cover a postage stamp. But it was white
of him not to let on. You&#8217;re lucky, Cap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, regular Smith luck,&#8221; put in Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t take any chances. Cut away to your room.
I can get you some raw beefsteak for the optic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An oyster is better,&#8221; declared Pete, and they scientifically
discussed the various merits of the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we had Professor Clatter here he&#8217;d paint it with
some eye dope and Cap would look all to the merry.&#8221; suggested
Bill. But the traveling medicine man was not
available, and Cap had to do the best he could.</p>

<p>It was some days before he was decently presentable and
North was just as bad. Of course the faculty must have
suspected the reason for the darkened eyes and bruised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
faces, but as there was no official report or complaint, nothing
was said of it, and the matter was dropped.</p>

<p>The upper classmen took up the question, and a sort
of truce was patched up between Cap and the bully, but
though North professed to be friendly there was a sullen
look in his eyes, and Cap knew he would do him a bad
turn if he got the chance. Mersfeld and North were
thicker than ever, and the Smith boys agreed among themselves
to be on their guard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was baseball a plenty. Some league
games were played, and a number of minor contests took
place. It was drawing close to the time for the annual
Freshman battle on the diamond with Tuckerton, and this
game was always a hotly contested one, and eagerly looked
forward to by the first year students and their friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;We stand a better chance to win this time, than ever
before,&#8221; remarked Armitage, who was captain of the first
year team. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got Bill to pitch, and he&#8217;s a wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Varsity twirler did occupy the box for the Freshmen
nine, and no objection had been raised to this arrangement
until nearly time for the Tuckerton game.
Then the nine of that school sent in a formal protest,
objection to Bill on the ground that though a first year
lad, he was not properly a member of the Freshman team,
since he was the Varsity pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll just ignore that objection, and if they
don&#8217;t want to play with Bill in the box we&#8217;ll claim the
game by forfeit,&#8221; decided Armitage. The dispute waxed
hot and an appeal was taken to the student body which
governed athletics among the members of the school
league. They decided that Bill could pitch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>&#8220;Well, he won&#8217;t if we fellows have any spunk,&#8221; declared
Borden, the Tuckerton captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spunk? How do you mean?&#8221; asked Swain, the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that we can put up a game on him so that he
can&#8217;t pitch against us, and they&#8217;ll have to put in Potter,
the substitute. We can knock <i>him</i> out of the box, but
Bill Smith is no easy mark. It means losing the game
for us to bat against Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can we do?&#8221; asked Swain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get Bill out of the way the day before the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kidnap him, of course. Spirit him away, and keep
him in cold storage until we win. Are you game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be done?&#8221; asked Swain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;ll arrange it, if you fellows will help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly we will, but how is it to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough. We&#8217;ll just meet him in the dark on
the road, bundle him into my auto, and take him to a
quiet place where he can&#8217;t get away.&#8221; Borden was a rich
youth, and had an automobile which he had brought to
school with him.</p>

<p>He went more into detail about his plan, and after
realizing that it would mean losing the game if Bill
pitched against them, his teammates somewhat reluctantly
agreed to the scheme. They thought they were within
their rights for they totally disagreed with the finding
of the governing body that Bill was entitled to pitch as a
Freshman, even though he was on the Varsity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose they find out we did it, and take the game
from us even after we win?&#8221; suggested Cadmus, who was
the Tuckerton Freshman catcher.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never discover it,&#8221; boasted Borden. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
lay it to some of the Sophs or Juniors at Westfield, and
Bill will never recognize us for we&#8217;ll wear masks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, we&#8217;re with you,&#8221; decided his chums. &#8220;Now
for the details.&#8221;</p>

<p>These were soon settled. It was agreed that Bill should
be captured the night before the game, when there would
be little chance that he could be rescued in time to play.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will we get hold of him,&#8221; asked Cadmus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send him some sort of a message,&#8221; replied Borden.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll write a note, in a disguised hand, and ask him to
call at a certain place in the village. We&#8217;ll be on the
lookout and when he goes past that lonely stretch of woods,
on the main road we&#8217;ll grab him, run him off in my car to
a place I know of, and leave him there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose some of his brothers or friends come with
him?&#8221; Swain wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we can get away with Bill before they realize
what&#8217;s up. You fellows want everything too easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>When, on the night before the game with Tuckerton,
Bill Smith received a note, asking him to call at a certain
hotel in the village, there to talk over baseball matters,
the pitcher showed the missive to his brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks sort of fishy,&#8221; decided Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name is signed to it?&#8221; inquired Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just says &#8216;Baseball Crank,&#8217;&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I think
it&#8217;s a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221; asked Whistle-Breeches.</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<p>&#8220;Might as well. But I&#8217;m going to go easy, and take a
look around before I go inside. Maybe I can turn the
tables.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>&#8220;Tell you what we&#8217;ll do,&#8221; broke in Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all go with Bill. Then, if there&#8217;s any trouble we
can help him. Maybe North or Mersfeld put up this
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad if you fellows
will come along, though it may be straight after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, after obtaining from the proctor permission to go
to the village on condition that they would be back before
locking-up time, the three Smith brothers, and Whistle-Breeches
sallied forth. They never suspected there might
be a joke perpetrated on them while on their way, rather
expecting some game in the village, and so proceeded along
the highway in careless ease, singing and joking.</p>

<p>As they reached a lonely stretch of woods, just below
getting into the village, three figures sprang out from
the underbrush. Over their faces were strips of cloth,
and at the first sight of the trio our friends drew back
in some alarm, feeling they had met with a gang of
highwaymen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one&mdash;in the centre!&#8221; called a hoarse voice,
and a grab was made for Bill. Before his brothers or
Whistle-Breeches could rally to his aid he was borne off,
struggling and kicking against his unknown captors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Into the car with him&mdash;quick!&#8221; was the whispered
order, and, ere the three lads left standing in the road
had recovered from their astonishment, there sounded
the chug-chug of an automobile, and Bill was whisked
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t that get your goat!&#8221; gasped Cap, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
he stood looking at the fast-disappearing red tail lamp
of the machine. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on after &#8217;em!&#8221; yelled Pete, starting down the
highway on a run. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to rescue him!&#8221;</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">TO THE RESCUE</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Here!</span> Come back!&#8221; cried Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; demanded Pete, pausing in the darkness,
and gazing first toward the disappearing red light and
then toward where his brother stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t catch an auto, no matter if you are a good
base runner,&#8221; replied the older Smith lad. &#8220;Come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I guess there isn&#8217;t much use running,&#8221;
admitted Pete dubiously, as he slowly returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ve got Bill, and we ought to help him.
Maybe they&#8217;ll hold him for a ransom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a joke,&#8221; decided Cap. &#8220;Come on, we&#8217;ve got
to use our brains against these fellows, and maybe we can
turn the tables on them. First we&#8217;ll go on to town, and
see if any of them really are at the hotel. We may get
a line on them there.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no trace of any one at the hostelry who
might, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered
as of those who had a part in the kidnapping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to school,&#8221; ordered Cap. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s
anything doing there.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not take long to learn that no hazing was going
on that night, and that none of the various school societies
were engaged in any pranks, and when it was made
clear that neither Mersfeld nor North had been out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
their rooms, they were absolved from the half-suspicion
that pointed to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Bill&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said Pete blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;s up to us to find him,&#8221; decided Cap. &#8220;I
guess to-morrow&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, to-morrow is the date for the big Freshman
game with Tuckerton!&#8221; exclaimed Whistle-Breeches.
&#8220;You know how they protested against him. I&#8217;ll bet a
cookie, without a hole in it, that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say no more!&#8221; burst out Bob Chapin, with a tragic
gesture. &#8220;The plot is laid bare! Tuckerton has our hero!
On to the rescue!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was too late to do anything that night, though
probably had the college authorities been appealed to they
would have permitted further search. However our
friends preferred to work out the problem themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile poor Bill was being rapidly carried away,
whither he knew not. All that he was aware of was that
a cloth had been wound around his head and face to prevent
him from seeing or from crying out. Then he was
bundled into an auto, and the car was speeded up.</p>

<p>Bill tried to listen and catch any sounds that might
indicate where he was being taken, but Borden, who
wanted to make speed had the muffler cut out and the
only noise the pitcher heard was that made by the machine.</p>

<p>It was a rough road over which he was being taken, and
the car swayed and pitched from side to side, tossing Bill
about. When he first felt himself grabbed by his unknown
assailants he had tried to struggle away from them, but
they had skilfully wound ropes about his legs and arms,
and now, bundled up as he was in one corner of the gasoline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
vehicle, he tried in vain to free himself. But the
ropes held.</p>

<p>At length, however, lack of air, by reason of the cloth
being too tightly drawn over his head, caused the unlucky
lad to give utterance to a muffled appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you fellows don&#8217;t want me to smother; do you?&#8221;
he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; came the cool answer. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
promise not to make a row we&#8217;ll take off some of the horse
blankets. How about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill listened intently. He did not recognize the voice.
He was minded to return a fierce answer, that he would
suit himself about calling for help, but he recalled that in
many cases discretion is the better part of valor. So,
rather meekly, he made answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be good, kind Mr. Highwayman!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stifled laugh at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Takes it well,&#8221; remarked one of his captors in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but wait,&#8221; was the significant comment. &#8220;You
take off some of the wrappings. Be careful he doesn&#8217;t spot
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill was soon more comfortable, as far as breathing was
concerned, but his limbs were still cramped from the cords
that bound them, and he was in a most uncomfortable
position. He seemed to be reclining in the tonneau of the
car, and some one was in the seat with him. He tried his
best to make out the features, but it was dark, and the
half masks which his captors wore prevented recognition.</p>

<p>Nor did the voices afford any clew, for when those in the
auto spoke it was either in half whispers or in mumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
words so that the tones were not clear. At first Bill
thought it was some of the students from Westfield who
were playing a joke on him, but later he changed this
opinion. He had an idea that it was either Mersfeld,
North or some of their crowd, but the conversation among
his captors soon disclosed that they were not these lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what they want of me, anyhow,&#8221; mused Bill.
&#8220;It was foolish to pay any attention to that note. I wish
I had looked more carefully at the writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, as he tried to recall the characters he was sure he
had never seen the hand before.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a joke, though, sure,&#8221; decided the pitcher. &#8220;And
it&#8217;s some young fellows who have me in tow. Guess I&#8217;ll
talk and see if they&#8217;ll answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He squirmed into an easier position, and fired this question
at those in the auto:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you taking me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon see,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever find out who you are, I&#8217;ll pay you back well
for this,&#8221; went on Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to&mdash;if you find out,&#8221; was the significant
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed the captive. &#8220;You&#8217;re
fellows from Sandrim, trying to get even for us boys
taking your boats,&#8221; went on Bill, for, not long before that,
the lads from Westfield had carried a lot of boats from
their rival school, and deposited the craft in the middle
of their own campus. &#8220;You&#8217;re from Sandrim,&#8221; declared
Bill positively.</p>

<p>A laugh was his only answer. The auto kept up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
speed, and presently turned from the main road, into a sort
of lane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the place?&#8221; asked the lad who was in the tonneau
with Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little farther,&#8221; answered the one at the wheel. &#8220;Look
out he doesn&#8217;t slip away from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; was the reply, and a hand took a
firmer grip of Bill&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>The car came to a sudden stop. A door of a building
which the pitcher could see was a sort of shack, or hut,
was opened, and a shaft of light came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you&mdash;&#8221; began a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, keep quiet!&#8221; was the quick retort. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
him. Help carry him to the room, and don&#8217;t talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Bill could prevent it he was again tied up, and
some one lifted him from the car. He was carried along
in the darkness, trying in vain to make out what sort of a
place he was in.</p>

<p>Then he was laid, none too gently, on a pile of some rags
in a corner of a dark room. The door was closed and Bill
was left alone with his anxious and gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Potato salad!&#8221; he gasped, half aloud, for the rags had
been removed from around his head, &#8220;I hope I get away
from here in time to play in the Freshman game to-morrow!
It will be fierce if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill listened. He could hear the auto puffing away. He
was left alone in the deserted shack&mdash;at least he thought
he was alone, for he heard no noise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bright and early the next morning Pete and Cap were
up, ready to go to the rescue of their brother. They arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
to cut their lectures that day, as did also Whistle-Breeches,
and, though many more students wanted to take
part in the search, it was thought best not to make too
much of the affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;For, whoever has done it will hear about us getting
excited about it and they&#8217;ll have more of a laugh on us than
ever,&#8221; declared Cap. &#8220;It&#8217;s a disgrace that we ever let Bill
be captured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; was Pete&#8217;s opinion. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll
get him back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their first move in the morning was to go to the place
where the kidnapping had occurred. There they saw the
marks of some auto wheels, but, as several cars had passed
by in the meanwhile it was impossible to do any tracing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to make inquiries,&#8221; decided Cap. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
ask along the road, of farmers and the people we meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not have much success for they could not
describe the auto, nor those in it, and many cars had gone
over the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my notion that you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; fer a needle in the
haystack,&#8221; was the opinion of one farmer whom they asked,
and when the boys thought of it, they nearly agreed with
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will we do at the game if he doesn&#8217;t show up?&#8221;
demanded Captain Armitage. &#8220;It will be fierce to go up
against Tuckerton without Bill in the box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>can</i> we do?&#8221; asked Pete hopelessly when a good
part of the morning had gone, and there was no trace of
the missing pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go right to Tuckerton, and accuse them!&#8221; suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the irate captain. &#8220;Tell them we know they spirited Bill
off, and demand that they produce him, or we&#8217;ll not play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d laugh at us,&#8221; said Cap. &#8220;Call us kindergartners,
and all that sort of thing. No, we can&#8217;t crawl that
way. But I believe the Tuckerton fellows <i>did</i> have a hand
in the game, and if we can only find out which of them
hired an auto I think we&#8217;d have a clew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe one of them owns a car,&#8221; suggested Whistle-Breeches.
It was a new thought for the searchers, and it
was received joyously.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jinks! That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; cried Cap. &#8220;Pete, you
get on that trail, and I&#8217;ll inquire at the only garage in
town if any of the fellows from Tuckerton hired a gasoline
gig there. I&#8217;ll meet you at the cross roads.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a place about half-way between the two schools
which were only a few miles apart.</p>

<p>With Pete went Whistle-Breeches, to help in the inquiry,
and Bob Chapin accompanied Cap. Meanwhile Captain
Armitage was in despair, for he had counted on Bill to win
the biggest part of the game, and without him he was sure
his nine would lose. On the other hand there was rejoicing
in the Tuckerton camp, when it was known that Bill
was missing, though only a few of the members of the
nine and its supporters, guessed the cause of his absence.</p>

<p>Noon came, and Bill was still among the missing. Cap
had obtained no news at the town garage, and though
Pete had learned that Borden of Tuckerton, owned a car,
he could not locate that youth or his machine. For the
nine had some grounds a distance from the school to practice
before the big game.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s no use,&#8221; said Cap despairingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
queer sort of a joke, if that&#8217;s what it is, and it looks as if
Bill would be out of the game. You&#8217;ll have to play without
him, Armitage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll wait until the last minute,&#8221; decided the captain.
&#8220;He may get away and join us. Lucky it&#8217;s on our
own grounds. We&#8217;ll have that advantage. Poor Bill. I
wonder where he is?&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">JUST IN TIME</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bill Smith</span>, about that same time, was wondering the
same thing. He had dozed off after his captors had left
him, but, with the first glint of morning sun into the room
where he was a prisoner he had awakened. He was still
bound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is pretty punk!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;To think
that they got ahead of me this way! I wonder where I
am, anyhow? And I wonder how I can get away, and back&mdash;Great
muskmelons! If I don&#8217;t show up at the game&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought was too much for Bill. He resolved on
bold tactics. Considering that his promise not to make
an outcry ended with the leaving of his captors, he raised
his voice in a shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! Come here, somebody! Let me out! Police!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill didn&#8217;t particularly want the police, for he knew
that his captivity was the result of some school prank, and
the boys never called on the officers of the law if they
could help it. But &#8220;Police!&#8221; was an easy word to say,
and it carried well. Therefore the captive yelled it again
and again.</p>

<p>But there was no answer to his cries, and after straining
his throat until it ached, the pitcher decided that he had
better save his breath and try other means to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;First to see if I can&#8217;t get rid of some of these ropes
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> my arms and legs,&#8221; he murmured. He tugged and
strained at them, after wiggling to a sitting position, but
the knots had been made with care, and held. Bill tried
to pull his hands from the loops but it was useless, and his
feet were equally secure. He could not gnaw through the
ropes as he had sometimes read of prisoners doing, for his
hands were tied behind his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am up against it,&#8221; he said aloud. Then, for
the first time, he took note of his prison. He was in a
vacant room, evidently in some old fashioned house, to
judge by the character of the woodwork and the wall paper.
There were two windows, and a door, the latter apparently
quite solid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look outside,&#8221; suggested Bill to himself.
He struggled to his feet, and, by a series of hops, gained
the windows. He was in the third story of a house, set
in the midst of a neglected garden, and the scene that
met the lad&#8217;s gaze was unfamiliar to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might be a hundred miles from nowhere, for all I
can tell,&#8221; he concluded dubiously. &#8220;Well, now for a try at
the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hopping over to the portal Bill turned around with his
back to it, and managed to reach the knob with his hands.
It turned, but the door was locked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing there!&#8221; exclaimed the captive. &#8220;Well,
here&#8217;s for some more noise.&#8221; He yelled and shouted at
the top of his voice, accompanying himself by beating on
the door with his bound fists. Silence was his only answer.</p>

<p>Once more Bill hopped to the window. He looked out,
hoping he might see some one to whom he could appeal.
Then, as he gazed helplessly out, he noted a nail driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
into one side of the casement. At once a plan came into
his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can rub the rope that binds my hands, up and
down over the head of that nail, I may fray the ropes
enough to break them,&#8221; he remarked aloud, for it made it
seem less lonesome to speak thus. &#8220;Once I get my hands
loose&mdash;&#8221; Bill did not finish, but he had great hopes of
what he could then do.</p>

<p>He began at once with the rusty nail as a knife. It was
hard work, and several times his hands slipped and his
wrists were scratched, but he kept at it, and finally found
that the cords were giving way. He worked faster, and
then, with a sudden strain he found his arms free. Then
it was an easy matter to loosen his feet, and he stood up
unbound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for a try at that door!&#8221; exclaimed the lad, and
after giving the knob a vigorous turn, and vainly pulling
on the portal he began to kick it violently.</p>

<p>He was engaged in this, at the same time yelling and
demanding to be released, when the door suddenly opened.
So suddenly in fact that Bill toppled outward with it,
and was caught in the arms of a big man who entered
quickly, carrying the captive backward with him, and
immediately locking the portal again.</p>

<p>Surprise bereft the lad of speech for a moment, and the
man, after gazing at him, and noting the ropes on the
floor, remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you got rid of &#8217;em yourself, I see. If you&#8217;d have
waited a little longer I&#8217;d have taken &#8217;em off. I&#8217;m a little
late getting here with your breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast!&#8221; gasped Bill. &#8220;You&#8217;d have taken off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
ropes! Say, what kind of a game am I up against, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the man easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well it isn&#8217;t all right,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t
let me out of here right away there&#8217;s going to be the biggest
row you ever saw,&#8221; and, as if in support of his assertion
the pitcher rushed over and began kicking on the
door again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum! Them fellers was right,&#8221; murmured the man
seemingly not a bit disturbed by what Bill was doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fellows?&#8221; demanded the pitcher, pausing in his
attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ones what brought you here. They said you&#8217;d cut
up rough, and make a lot of fuss, an&#8217; by gum, they was
right! I guess you sure enough do need a straight-jacket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A straight-jacket!&#8221; gasped poor Bill. &#8220;Say, for the
love of cats, tell me what I&#8217;m up against; won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; was the calm reply. &#8220;I was
told to humor you until the keeper come, an&#8217; I&#8217;m doin&#8217;
it. What would you like for breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any&mdash;let me out!&#8221; pleaded Bill. He was
beginning to see the joke now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dast,&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;The fellers what
brung you here said you was dangerous at times, an&#8217; I
might be held responsible. They fetched you here in an
automobile, an&#8217; arranged with me to leave you in this vacant
house of mine until they could come again, with keepers
from the lunatic asylum, to take you away. I&#8217;m expectin&#8217;
&#8217;em every minute, but they said I was to untie you by daylight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
an&#8217; feed you, as you was less violent when it wasn&#8217;t
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, look here!&#8221; cried Bill. &#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;At least, no, I ain&#8217;t
neither. There I clean forgot to say what them fellers
told me to. No you ain&#8217;t crazy. I am, an&#8217; everybody else
is, but you&#8217;re sane. That&#8217;s what they said I was to tell
you, if you asked me that question. All crazy persons
thinks they are sane,&#8221; he went on in explanation. &#8220;You&#8217;re
sane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here!&#8221; pleaded the captive. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m
sane. I&#8217;m a student at Westfield, and the fellows who
brought me are either students from there, or from some
other school, playing a joke on me. Now let me go!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me you&#8217;d say that, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
let you go. I promised to keep you here until the keepers
came, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do it. Now take it easy and you&#8217;ll
be all right. I&#8217;ll bring you some breakfast. You look
hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, but say&mdash;&#8221; Then the hopelessness of appealing
any further to the man came forcibly to Bill, and he was
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; announced the man, preparing to unlock
the door again. &#8220;I live over here a little way. This house
belongs to me, but it&#8217;s been vacant some time, so you can
yell and holler all you please&mdash;no one will hear you. I&#8217;ll
go get you some victuals. Is there anything special you&#8217;d
like? My wife is a good cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bring anything,&#8221; said poor Bill. He knew that he
would have to eat if he was to keep up his strength, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
had determined to try to escape by the windows as soon as
he was left alone again. He had a wild idea of making a
rush when the farmer opened the door, but a look at the
bulky frame of the man made him change his mind.</p>

<p>The food was good and Bill ate a hearty meal. Then he
was left alone again, the farmer, on locking the door, saying
that he expected the keepers any moment. It was evident
that he believed the stories the captors of Bill had
told him.</p>

<p>Once he was alone, and when a look from the windows
had assured him that he was not being watched, Bill began
to put into operation his plan of getting away.</p>

<p>He hoped that the ropes which had bound him would
enable him to make his way down them out of the window,
but on tying the pieces together he discovered that they
were not long enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up against it!&#8221; exclaimed the lad, until, looking more
carefully out of the end casement he discovered that a
stout lightning rod ran near it, down the side of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the cheese, if it will hold me,&#8221; murmured
the lad. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to try it anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crawled out on the window sill, tested the rod as best
he could, and then swung himself down it. To his joy
it held, and in a few seconds he was safe on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now to find out where I am, and streak it for school
and the game!&#8221; he murmured, looking around to see that
the farmer was not in sight. He got his bearings and
was soon out on a dusty highway. He ran for some distance
until a turn in the road hid the house of his captivity
from him, and then slowed down to a walk.</p>

<p>The surroundings were still unfamiliar to him, but meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
a man driving a carriage he learned that he was near
the village of Belleville, about twenty miles from Westfield.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s coming on noon, I haven&#8217;t half enough to buy
a railroad ticket, and the game is called at two o&#8217;clock!&#8221;
groaned Bill. &#8220;I certainly am up against it good and
hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man whom he had accosted was going in the wrong
direction, or he would have given the lad a lift. However,
he did consent to drive him to the railroad station.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see if I can&#8217;t give the agent a hard-luck story, and
have him trust me for a ticket,&#8221; thought the pitcher.</p>

<p>But the station agent proved to be a hard-featured man,
who had once lost a dollar by lending it to a young lady
who told him a pathetic story, and he turned a deaf ear
to Bill&#8217;s pleading.</p>

<p>&#8220;No money no ticket,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; gasped Bill. &#8220;Some fellows, either at
my school, or from Tuckerton, played a joke on me last
night&mdash;kidnapped me. I&#8217;m to pitch in the championship
Freshman baseball game at two o&#8217;clock this afternoon,
and I&#8217;ve just <i>got</i> to be there. I&#8217;ll pay you back if you
trust me for a ticket. Or say, you can ship me as express,
C. O. D. and the boys will pay the charges at Westfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Live stock has to travel in cattle cars, not as express,&#8221;
answered the agent with a grim smile. &#8220;Besides I don&#8217;t
believe in baseball anyhow. Some boys was battin&#8217; a hall
once, an&#8217; they busted one of the windows in this ticket
office. I had to pay for it, too! I ain&#8217;t got no manner of
likin&#8217; for baseball.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill saw that it was no use in pleading, and turned
away. With despair in his heart he noted that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
nearly one o&#8217;clock. He might as well give up. Already
the players were beginning to get ready for the game. In
fancy he could hear the words of wonder at his absence
from the diamond.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may think I threw the game,&#8221; thought Bill, and
then he remembered that his brothers and Whistle-Breeches
had seen him captured, and would tell the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d come to the rescue if they only knew where to
come, too,&#8221; thought Bill gloomily.</p>

<p>The pitcher was in desperate straits. A search through
his pockets disclosed the fact that he had nothing to pawn
on which to raise money, even if there had been a pawn
shop in the village. He was just giving up, deciding to
walk to Westfield, hoping to arrive before dark, when, as
he left the station he nearly collided with a pretty girl,
who was just entering, having alighted from a trim
little motor car, that was still puffing outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; mumbled Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed the girl. &#8220;I&mdash;why it&#8217;s Mr. Smith!&#8221;
she cried, holding out her hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to meet you
again. But why aren&#8217;t you over at school at the big
game? I&#8217;m on my way there.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment you could have knocked Bill down with
the wind from a slow ball, as he afterward expressed it.
He looked at the girl, and recognized her as Miss Ruth
Morton, to whom he had been introduced by Bob Chapin
at one of the school games.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Morton!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I&mdash;Oh, if you&#8217;re
going to Westfield will you take me? I&#8217;m marooned!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, rapidly, he blurted out the whole story of his
capture and his inability to get back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>&#8220;Take you! Of course I&#8217;ll take you!&#8221; exclaimed Miss
Morton. &#8220;I have to stop for a girl friend, who is going to
the game with me, but there&#8217;ll be plenty of room for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride on the mud guard or hang on back!&#8221; exclaimed
Bill, a gleam of hope lighting his woe-begone countenance.
&#8220;Only I want to beat Tuckerton!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I want you to, even if a&mdash;a friend of mine goes
there. I think it was an awfully mean trick they played
on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not <i>sure</i> any Tuckerton fellows did it,&#8221; said
Bill, who wanted to play fair. &#8220;It may have been some of
the Westfield crowd,&#8221; but he had his own opinion.</p>

<p>Miss Morton, who had come to the station to inquire
about some express package, hurried out to her car, followed
by Bill. He offered to run it for her, but she was
not a little proud of her own ability to drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to make time,&#8221; suggested the pitcher
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do it,&#8221; the girl assured him, and, once she had
thrown in the third gear, the pitcher had no reason to complain
of lack of speed.</p>

<p>Miss Morton&#8217;s girl friend&mdash;Miss Hazel Dunning&mdash;was
taken aboard and then, with Bill sitting on the floor in
front, and resting his feet on the mud-guard step, for the
machine was only a runabout, the trip to Westfield was
begun.</p>

<p>Back on the school diamond there was an anxious
throng of students and players. The news of Bill&#8217;s kidnapping
was known all over, and while there was despair in
the ranks of the Westfield Freshmen and their supporters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
there was ill-concealed joy among the Tuckerton nine and
their adherents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those fellows know where Bill is,&#8221; declared Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t dare accuse them,&#8221; agreed Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll lose the game,&#8221; went on Armitage dubiously.</p>

<p>Bill never forgot his trip with Miss Morton. She was
a daring driver, for a girl, and once or twice took chances
that made even the nerve-hardened pitcher wince. But
with a merry laugh she sped on, after cutting in ahead
of a load of hay, on a narrow bridge.</p>

<p>Once there was a hail from a speed-watching constable
but the girl kept on.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s oil on my number, and I never expect to come
this way again,&#8221; she declared recklessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only we don&#8217;t get a blow-out!&#8221; murmured Miss
Dunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare suggest such a thing, Hazel!&#8221; cried
Miss Morton.</p>

<p>She turned on more speed. It lacked five minutes to
two, and Bill knew the game would be called on the dot.
They were two miles away, and could hardly get there on
time, but the pitcher consoled himself with the reflection
that at least he could take part after the first inning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we going to make it?&#8221; asked Miss Dunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to!&#8221; declared Miss Morton, as she swung
around in front of a farm wagon, thereby causing the
grizzled driver symptoms of heart failure.</p>

<p>Bill could hear the shouts on the diamond now. He
was in a fever of excitement, and stood up to catch a first
glimpse of the field. Miss Morton, with her lips set firmly
around her pretty mouth grasped the steering wheel more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
rigidly and drove on. Toward the diamond she turned.
There was another cheer from the crowd, but Bill could not
see what was going on, and feared the game had started.
There came a break in the throng and he had a glimpse
of the field. What he saw reassured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just in time!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;They&#8217;re only practicing!&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaped out as the girl brought the car to a sudden
stop with both brakes grinding and screeching.</p>

<p>&#8220;See you later! A thousand thanks&mdash;never could have
done it but for you, Miss Morton!&#8221; burst out Bill as he ran
over the grass. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me either,&#8221; murmured the girl. &#8220;I never drove so
fast before in all my life, but I wasn&#8217;t going to tell him
so,&#8221; she confided to her chum, as they left the car and
walked toward the grand stand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A SCRIMMAGE</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Play</span> ball!&#8221; called the umpire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! Wait!&#8221; begged Bill breathlessly, as he ran forward.
&#8220;I&#8217;m in time! I can play. Where&#8217;s Armitage?
I&#8217;ve been locked up&mdash;couldn&#8217;t get here before! Can&#8217;t I
play?&#8221;</p>

<p>A cheer greeted Bill&#8217;s unexpected appearance. His
brothers who had given up hope rushed forward to clap
him on the back. Whistle-Breeches did a war dance
around him. There was wild rejoicing among the Westfield
Freshmen. The Tuckerton Freshmen looked glum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he got here after all,&#8221; muttered Swain, the
pitcher, to Captain Borden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That farmer must have let him go before I
meant him to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do&mdash;protest again?&#8221; asked
Cadmus.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; what&#8217;s the use? I think they&#8217;re suspicious as it
is. All we can do now is to play to beat &#8217;em. Hang the
luck anyhow, but&mdash;I s&#8217;pose it serves us right.&#8221; Borden had
the grace to admit that much.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bill had rapidly told the story of his captivity
and his ride in the auto.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what we ought to do!&#8221; declared Armitage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
angrily, &#8220;we ought to refuse to play them, and claim
the game. The idea of kidnapping our pitcher!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy!&#8221; exclaimed Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; put in Bill. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t hurt any, and it
was rather a lark after I got away. Besides we don&#8217;t know
for sure that Borden and his crowd did it, though I&#8217;m
almost positive it was his auto. But never mind. Let&#8217;s
play ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late to get into uniform,&#8221; remarked the captain,
&#8220;and we&#8217;re to take the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pitch as I am, and borrow a uniform when it&#8217;s our
turn to bat,&#8221; spoke Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;But can you twirl?&#8221; inquired his brother. &#8220;After what
you&#8217;ve been through&mdash;away all night&mdash;knocked around in
an auto, no decent meal&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong, I had one good meal, and
the next one can wait until we win the game. Miss Morton&mdash;she&#8217;s
several kinds of a pretty brick, by the way&mdash;she
got some sandwiches on the trip in. My! She&#8217;s a stunner!
How she did drive! She&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, get in your box, and play ball,&#8221; interrupted Armitage,
with a laugh at Bill&#8217;s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>There were dubious looks on the faces of the Tuckerton
players at the advent of the talented pitcher, but a gleam
of hope came when Borden whispered that he might be
all out of condition from his captivity, and could not hold
his own in the box.</p>

<p>Curiously enough it did not occur to any of the conspiring
rivals of Westfield that they had taken an unfair advantage
in spiriting Bill away. They felt that he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
right, as the Varsity pitcher, to play with the Freshmen
against them.</p>

<p>But if they hoped that Bill was out of condition they
were doomed to disappointment, for when he had put on
his glasses, which Cap had brought with him on a forlorn
chance, Bill never pitched better ball. At first he was a
little stiff, and issued several passes, whereat there was rejoicing
among the visitors, and grim despair in the ranks of
the home team. But Bill shook off his momentary indisposition,
and when the final inning had ended in a dazzling
succession of plays, the Westfield team had won by a score
of ten runs to three.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, Oh, wow!&#8221; cried Armitage, hugging Bill. &#8220;If
you hadn&#8217;t come along we&#8217;d have been in the soup!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; objected Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;Swain was in great
form to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Bill was better,&#8221; added Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could make a story out of what you went through,&#8221;
drawled Bob Chapin. &#8220;Ring in Miss Morton as the
heroine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for her I&#8217;d never have made it,&#8221; agreed Bill, as he
went over to shake hands with the pretty, blushing girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was fine! Fine!&#8221; cried Miss Morton, as she
greeted Bill and his companions who surrounded her and
Miss Dunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly wonderful the way you struck out the last
three men,&#8221; went on the other girl.</p>

<p>Bill blushed behind his ears. He was too tanned to
have the color show elsewhere.</p>

<p>And so the Tuckerton-Westfield Freshmen game passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
into school history, and Bill never really found out who
had kidnapped him. In fact he never tried, for he concluded
that his suspicions were good enough, and he did
not want revenge.</p>

<p>The summer crept on, and the close of the term was near
at hand. More games were played, and Westfield was doing
well. She did not have, as yet by any means, a clear
title to the pennant. In fact the loss of a few games would
mean that Tuckerton or Sandrim would get it, but the
Smith boys and their chums were working hard.</p>

<p>As for Mersfeld he was still under the ban, for when
he was allowed to resume athletics he had gone so stale
that after a try-out he was relegated to the ranks of the
subs for the Varsity, and Bill&#8217;s place as first pitcher was
undisputed. And there was bitterness in the heart of
the former twirler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I could only get square with him!&#8221; he muttered
to North.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one way to put him out of the running,&#8221;
declared that worthy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To get his special glasses. He can&#8217;t get another pair
made in time now, for that old codger of an astronomer
has been arrested I hear, and the other professor hasn&#8217;t
been around lately. There&#8217;s only a week more before the
close of the season, and if you get the specks Bill couldn&#8217;t
pitch. You might have a chance then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could get &#8217;em, but we risked it once, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to do it differently this time. No more trying
to sneak into his room. We&#8217;ve got to take the glasses
away from him personally.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>&#8220;How? Hold him up some dark night? That won&#8217;t
do, for he only carries them with him going to and from
the games.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s just when I mean to take them. If we could
get him into what would look like a friendly scrimmage
say, one of us could frisk the glasses out of his pocket, and
he&#8217;d be left when he tried to pitch next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. If you&#8217;re with me just hang around the next
time Bill comes off the diamond. I&#8217;ll start something,
you come back at me, we&#8217;ll run around Bill and his brothers&mdash;maybe
upset &#8217;em, and in the confusion if I can&#8217;t get the
glasses I&#8217;m no good. I know where he carries &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, North. If I can only get back on the team
I&#8217;d do anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s settled,&#8221; was the reply, and the two cronies
walked away together, talking of their mean plot.</p>

<p>Their chance came the next day, when a crowd of the
players were returning from the ball field after a practice
game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tag, you&#8217;re it!&#8221; suddenly cried North to Mersfeld, and
he began circling about Bill, Pete and Cap, who were
walking with Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, cut it out!&#8221; cried Mersfeld, as if in objection, and
he tripped North up. The latter in falling made a grab
for Bill, as if to save himself, and in an instant the two
went down in a heap and there was a laughing, struggling
crowd of youths rolling over the grass in what was apparently
a friendly scrimmage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE GLASSES ARE GONE</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Here</span> get up off me, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; demanded Bill, as he
found himself under North&#8217;s no light weight. The latter
had his arms around the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry. Did I hurt you?&#8221; asked the bully with elaborate
politeness as he helped Bill to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I don&#8217;t want my nose rubbed in the dirt. It
might spoil the shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Wait until I get hold of Mersfeld. It
was his fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>North scurried off, pretending to be in pursuit of his
crony, while Cap, Pete and Whistle-Breeches, who had
gone down in the melee were fighting off several of their
chums who, seeing the prostrate group, had, boy fashion,
thrown themselves on top, a-la-football practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say, this is too much!&#8221; gasped Cap, as he tossed
Bob Chapin to one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, who started this, anyhow?&#8221; demanded Pete, digging
some grass out of his left ear.</p>

<p>The skirmishing and fun were general now, and no one
seemed to remember that Mersfeld and North had been the
storm centre. The two were far enough away, over the
campus by this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, did you get &#8217;em?&#8221; asked Mersfeld nervously, as
he looked back at the throng of lads who had ceased their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
struggles and were brushing what they could of the dirt
off their clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure did,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Look,&#8221; and he showed
him a small black case, which, on being opened, disclosed
the peculiar glasses that Bill wore when he pitched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the deposed pitcher. &#8220;Now what&#8217;ll
we do with &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you take &#8217;em,&#8221; and North held them out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; came the quick answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think I want to be caught with them on me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want &#8217;em either. Shall I throw &#8217;em
away?&#8221; and he made a half-motion toward a clump of
bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, some one might find &#8217;em, and give &#8217;em back, and
then we&#8217;d be as badly off as before. Here, I&#8217;ll tell you
what to do. Toss &#8217;em into that old cannon,&#8221; and Mersfeld
pointed to one on the far edge of the campus. It was a
Spanish war trophy, loaned by the government. &#8220;No one
will ever think of looking there for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a quick motion North slid the case of spectacles
down the muzzle. Then the two quickly kept on their
way.</p>

<p>Bill and his friends proceeded to the gymnasium, where
the players indulged in a shower bath, and, a little later
the three brothers were in Cap&#8217;s room, talking over baseball
matters in particular, and everything in general.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; mused the pitcher as he looked over a schedule
of dates. &#8220;We play Northampton day after to-morrow,
Sandrim the next day, and then Saturday winds up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
season with Tuckerton. And say, fellows, do you know
we&#8217;ve got to win every game to keep the pennant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Cap. &#8220;I thought we had a
good lead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we did have, but Tuckerton and Sandrim have
pulled up on us, and it&#8217;s almost a tie now. Yes, we&#8217;ve got
to make a clean sweep from now on or we&#8217;ll not be in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can do it,&#8221; declared Pete vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; asserted Whistle-Breeches, as if it was the most
simple thing in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly, my lords and gentlemen,&#8221; added Bob
Chapin half-mockingly. &#8220;Just sit here and figure it out
by averages and percentages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dry up!&#8221; advised Cap. &#8220;How&#8217;s your arm holding out,
Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess I&#8217;ll manage, though we&#8217;re going to have a
grandstand finish this week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about your eyes,&#8221; asked Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you get along without the glasses yet, Bill? I&#8217;m always
afraid a ball will crack into them, and then you <i>would</i> be
out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That part never worries me,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;m so used
to &#8217;em now that I&#8217;d feel lost in the box without &#8217;em. They
certainly were a great thing, and I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, and hurriedly crossed the room to
where his uniform was picturesquely draped over a chair.
Rapidly the pitcher felt through the pockets, and a look
of alarm came over his face. He began tossing aside a
multitudinous collection of articles on his bureau.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, something bite you?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>

<p>Bill did not answer. He was feeling now in the pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of the suit he wore. As he went from one to the other
his face assumed a more and more worried look.</p>

<p>&#8220;For cats&#8217; sake what is it?&#8221; demanded Cap. &#8220;Lost a
love letter? We won&#8217;t read it if we find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My glasses!&#8221; gasped Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your glasses?&#8221; repeated Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;they&#8217;re gone,&#8221; and with a wild look on his face
the pitcher dashed from the room and ran toward the
gymnasium, followed by his brothers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">MERSFELD IN THE BOX</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a wild search in and about the gymnasium
on the part of Bill, his brothers and his chums, but of
course the missing glasses were not found.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you dropped them here?&#8221; asked Cap, as
he went over again the room which his brother had used
as a dressing department before and after the shower bath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not sure, of course,&#8221; answered Bill, &#8220;but
they&#8217;re gone, and I must have dropped them somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went over the place inch by inch, looked in odd
nooks and corners and inquired of the janitors and helpers,
but the spectacles were not found.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; cried Whistle-Breeches with sudden illumination,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you dropped them that time we were all fooling
on the campus!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jinks! I believe I did!&#8221; cried Bill, and he made a
mad dash for the place. The others followed and soon
the lads were scanning the grass, going about on their hands
and knees. From a vantage point Mersfeld and North
watched.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s missed &#8217;em all right,&#8221; exulted the deposed pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and he&#8217;ll look a good while for &#8217;em, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think he&#8217;ll suspect us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; replied North. He started toward the
group of searching lads.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>&#8220;Here! Where are you going?&#8221; cried his companion in
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going over to help &#8217;em hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back! Do you want to give the whole thing
away, just when I&#8217;ve got a last chance to get back on the
nine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it away, you chump! Why the best way to throw
&#8217;em off the track, and make &#8217;em feel sure that we had nothing
to do with it is to help Bill look for his glasses. Come
on. It&#8217;ll be a joke, but they can&#8217;t appreciate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somewhat dubious of the plan, Mersfeld followed North,
who strolled up to Bill. The Varsity pitcher&#8217;s face wore
a worried look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lose something?&#8221; asked North innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my glasses. They must have dropped out of my
pocket when we were skylarking here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; and North winked at Mersfeld.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll help you look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed the deposed pitcher, and the two hypocrites
went carefully over the ground, laughing to themselves
as they thought of the glasses in the muzzle of the
cannon.</p>

<p>Darkness came and the search had to be given up.
Puzzled as to what could have happened to his glasses,
uselessly and mechanically feeling in pocket after pocket,
Bill accompanied his brothers back to his room. Mersfeld
and North went off together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what are you going to do?&#8221; asked Pete, as he
looked at the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do,&#8221; and Bill&#8217;s tone was despondent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>&#8220;Maybe you can get along without them now, for the
few remaining games,&#8221; suggested Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; and Bill shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;ll need them, for I
tried to pitch without them to-day, and my curves were
away off. And as for the remaining games&mdash;they&#8217;re the
most important of the season. We&#8217;ve just <i>got</i> to win them
to make good and keep the pennant. I don&#8217;t see what
could have happened to the glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have lost them anywhere between the diamond
and here,&#8221; said Whistle-Breeches. &#8220;We&#8217;ll look again
in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; cried Pete. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you get some oculist in town
to fix you up a pair that will do? It can&#8217;t be that they
were such peculiar glasses that they can&#8217;t be duplicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; half-agreed Bill, &#8220;but the old rain-maker-astronomer
said the lenses had to be ground in a certain
way, and I don&#8217;t know where he had them made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try some one in town,&#8221; went on Cap. &#8220;I believe
they can fix you up,&#8221; and they spent some time talking of
that possibility.</p>

<p>Bill was worried, and with good reason. He wanted to
maintain his position as pitcher, and he knew he could
not do so if he did not &#8220;deliver the goods.&#8221; That he could
pitch without the glasses he did not believe, but he was
anxious for morning to come that he might test himself
again.</p>

<p>Bright and early he and Cap went out to the diamond,
not only to look for the glasses but to do some work with
the horsehide. It is needless to say that the glasses were
not recovered, and to Bill&#8217;s despair he found that he was
throwing wild.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do,&#8221; spoke Cap despondently, as he tossed
back the ball which he had had to reach away outside of
the plate to gather in.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I guess not,&#8221; agreed his brother. &#8220;It&#8217;s either a
new pair of specs for me, or&mdash;some one else in the box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to get a new pair of glasses first,&#8221; suggested
Cap, as cheerfully as he could.</p>

<p>An oculist whom they consulted, but not the one to whom
they had first gone after the accident, looked grave when
he had tested Bill&#8217;s eyes, and heard the story of the blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I can fit you with glasses,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it
may take some time to get them just right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221; asked the pitcher anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;A week&mdash;perhaps two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do!&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;Why the last Sandrim
game comes off in three days, and a week later the final
with the Tuckerton nine. I&#8217;ve got to pitch in both.&#8221;</p>

<p>The oculist shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The lenses will have to be
specially ground. If I knew where the others were made
I could get them from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the astronomer had failed to say where he had had
Bill&#8217;s glasses made, and there was nothing for it but to try
some other lens-making place. Meanwhile the oculist said
he would temporarily fit Bill with a pair of glasses.</p>

<p>But when the pitcher tried to use them, his curves were
worse off than before, and with despair in his heart he
laid aside the spectacles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to wait for the others,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about the game with Sandrim?&#8221; asked Captain
Graydon. &#8220;Can you pitch for us?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>Bill shook his head, and said nothing. The captain and
coach looked at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to put Mersfeld back in the box,&#8221; decided
Mr. Windam dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he&#8217;ll have to practice hard every spare minute,
and even then&mdash;&#8221; The captain did not finish, but
they knew what he meant.</p>

<p>It was with wild and ill-concealed exultation in his
heart that Mersfeld received orders to take his old place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s up to you to make good!&#8221; said North to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll do it, too!&#8221; was the fierce response. &#8220;Bill
Smith shan&#8217;t get his hands on the ball again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mersfeld began hard and steady practice, and, whether
it was that the rest had done him good, or whether he had
improved did not develop, but there was a more hopeful
look on the faces of the captain and coach.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may do Sandrim yet,&#8221; said Graydon, &#8220;and if Bill
can get his glasses in time for the Tuckerton game we may
pull out ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, but it&#8217;s going to be a hard row to hoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill and his brothers and friends made strenuous efforts
in the little while that remained to get the glasses in
time, but there was a delay, the lenses were not ready, and
when the day of the final game with Sandrim arrived Mersfeld
was in the box.</p>

<p>Bill sat on the bench, bitterness in his heart, his fingers
fairly aching to get hold of the ball. But he knew that
his eyes were practically useless.</p>

<p>It was a hard game, and Westfield won it only by the
hardest kind of work, and the narrow margin of one run.
It was due more to the support Mersfeld got than to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
pitching that he pulled the contest out of the fire, and at
one time, when Sandrim had three men on bases, and none
out it looked like a walk-over for them.</p>

<p>But Cap, who was behind the bat, and Pete, at short,
were towers of strength, and once more the Smith boys,
even though the trio was broken, demonstrated their worth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if we can take Tuckerton&#8217;s scalp we&#8217;ll be all
right,&#8221; remarked the coach to the captain, as they strolled
off the diamond after the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but we need Bill. Oh, if his eyes would only get
right again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, or if he can only get his glasses in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was three days later before the oculist had the special
lenses, and Bill tried them hopefully. At first they seemed
to be all right, but after he had pitched a few balls Cap
called to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get &#8217;em over a little better, Bill. That last one was
quite a ways out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Why it went right over the plate!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pete who was behind Cap, watching his brother&#8217;s curves
started, and the oldest Smith lad shook his head. Then
Bill knew that the glasses were not the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s all up,&#8221; he said despondently. &#8220;I&#8217;m out
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Cap. &#8220;We&#8217;ll help you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you do?&#8221; Bill wanted to know. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
use having this oculist try it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but we&#8217;ll find Professor Clatter and Tithonus
Somnus and get him to make a right pair of glasses.
That&#8217;s our last chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a mighty slim one, too!&#8221; murmured Bill, &#8220;with
the final game only a few days off!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">BILL&#8217;S FALL</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the oculist learned that the glasses he had made
for Bill were practically useless, he wanted to try again,
and, as there could be no harm in it, and as some good
might result, the pitcher consented. But he and his brothers
at once began the task of trying to locate Professor
Clatter and his friend the astronomer.</p>

<p>And a task it was, for they had nothing by which to
go. The Smith boys knew the towns at which the medicine
man usually stopped in his travels, and telegrams were
sent to the police of each one, asking them to have Mr.
Clatter at once get into communication with his former
friends. But the answers that came back stated that the
professor had not recently been in the town addressed or
else had just left.</p>

<p>The time was getting woefully short. Preparations
were completed for the final and deciding game of the
series, which as far as the pennant went, was a tie between
Tuckerton and Westfield.</p>

<p>With the exception of their pitcher Westfield had the
best nine in many years, and her rival was equally well
provided for. It would be the hottest game of the season,
and indications pointed to record-breaking attendance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I only could pitch!&#8221; sighed poor Bill. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the one game of the year.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>&#8220;And Miss Morton will be there,&#8221; added Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, hang it all. Oh, I&#8217;ve a good notion to get some
surgeon to operate on me, and see if he can&#8217;t straighten
my eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No time for that now,&#8221; said Pete sadly, for he and his
brother, as well as all their friends, sympathized deeply
with Bill. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard luck, old man, but it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mersfeld was practicing early and late, and even Cap,
who was to be behind the bat, had to admit that the former
twirler was in good form.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t touch you when you are at your best though,
Bill,&#8221; he said to his brother, &#8220;and I wish you were going to
be in the box, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It now seemed practically sure that no help could be
had from Professor Clatter or his odd friend. And the
second pair of glasses made by the oculist were worse than
the first. Bill&#8217;s vision was away out of focus when he used
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me for the bench again,&#8221; he said the night before
the big game, and nothing that his brothers or friends
could say consoled him.</p>

<p>A vigorous search was still kept up for the missing case
of spectacles, and notices were posted about the school regarding
them, but they were still in the cannon, and no
one thought of looking there, save the two conspirators,
and of course they did not. There was unholy joy between
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got what you wanted,&#8221; said North to Mersfeld when
the make-up of the nine for the concluding championship
game was announced the night preceding it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, thanks to you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, well, I&#8217;ll depend upon you to help me out, sometime.
I&#8217;ve got a score to pay back to Cap Smith yet,&#8221; and
there was a vindictive look on the bully&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>The Westfield nine went out on the diamond for early
practice on the morning of the game, and Mersfeld seemed
in good form. There was a confident smile on his face
as he threw the balls to Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it up,&#8221; advised the catcher, who wished in vain
that his big mitt was receiving the swift balls his brother
could send in, in place of those from Mersfeld.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuckerton is bringing along two extra pitchers I hear,&#8221;
said the captain to Coach Windam. &#8220;They must be looking
for a hard game!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we give it to &#8217;em! As for box men, we&#8217;ll put
Mersfeld in, of course, and if worst comes to worst and he
doesn&#8217;t last we&#8217;ll have to rely on Newton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. Oh, if only Bill Smith&mdash;! But what&#8217;s
the use, we&#8217;ll do the best we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of the great game. Already the
grandstands on the Westfield grounds were beginning to
fill up with the cohorts of the two schools, and other spectators
who came to look on, and cheer. There were pretty
girls galore, and a glance over the seats showed a riot of
colors from the hats and dresses of the maidens, to the gay
banners and ribbons on horns and canes.</p>

<p>The Tuckerton nine had arrived in a big coach, and
their entrance on the diamond was a signal for a burst of
cheers and many songs.</p>

<p>Then out trotted the home team, and there was a wild
burst of barbaric voices in greeting, while rival singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
bands, more or less in harmony, chanted the praises of their
respective teams.</p>

<p>The Smith boys were with their mates, and, even though
he knew he was not going to play, Bill had put on a
uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll feel better sitting on the bench than up in the
stand,&#8221; he said to his chums. He tried to smile, but it
was a woeful imitation.</p>

<p>There was a sharp practice by both teams. Cap took
Mersfeld to a secluded spot, and gave him some final advice
about signals, before they started to warm-up. Bill,
who wanted to see how his rival was handling the horsehide
strolled over to watch him and Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty good,&#8221; he said to Mersfeld, who had pitched in
some hot ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you think so,&#8221; was the somewhat ungracious answer.
&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll do.&#8221; Mersfeld was anything but
modest.</p>

<p>It was almost time for the game to be called. Just back
of where Bill was watching his brother and Mersfeld,
Whistle-Breeches was knocking grounders to Pete, who was
to play shortstop. Some one threw in a ball from the outfield
to one of the fungle batters. The sphere went wild,
and came toward Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; yelled Pete, and Anderson raised his bat
intending to stop the wildly-thrown horsehide. He hit it
harder than he intended, and it was shunted off in the
direction of Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Duck!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed Cap, who saw his brother&#8217;s
danger, and instinctively Bill dodged. He turned to one
side so quickly that he lost his balance, and the next moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
he fell heavily, his head striking the ground with
considerable force, while the ball landed some distance
from him.</p>

<p>They all expected to see Bill jump to his feet with a
laugh at his awkwardness, but to the surprise of all he remained
lying there, still and quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill&#8217;s hurt!&#8221; cried Cap, making a dash toward him,
while several other players came hurrying forward to see
what was the matter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">&#8220;PLAY BALL!&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cap Smith</span> was the first to reach his brother. As he
lifted him up Bill opened his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I can stand alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He proved it by doing so. His hand went to his head,
and when it came away there was a little smear of blood on
the palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must have hit on a stone and cut myself,&#8221; he said, a
bit faintly. &#8220;But I&#8217;m all right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; asked Pete, slipping his arm around
his brother. &#8220;Better come over here and sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led Bill to the bench, and indeed the pitcher was a
trifle dizzy, and his head felt queer, for he had fallen
harder than he had supposed.</p>

<p>The other players, finding that nothing serious was the
matter went back to their practice. In the grandstands
the singing and cheering was multiplied. Crowds of pretty
girls, eager youths, demure chaperones, old grads, young
grads and mere spectators continued to arrive until every
seat was filled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a great game,&#8221; murmured Cap, who,
finding that his brother was apparently all right, resumed,
his catching with Mersfeld. &#8220;I never saw such a crowd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s money in the treasury whether we win the pennant
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> not,&#8221; declared J. Evans Green, the business-like manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we <i>are</i> going to win!&#8221; declared Cap emphatically.
&#8220;Keep &#8217;em guessing, Mersfeld, and you&#8217;ll do. Now when
I put three fingers on my mitt so, let me have a swift drop,&#8221;
and he went on with his code of signals.</p>

<p>The conferences between the respective captains had
ended, and Burke, head of the Tuckerton Varsity nine,
signalled to his men to come in from practice, as they were
to bat first. Graydon assembled his team for a few final
instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry you&#8217;re not playing with us to-day,&#8221; he said to
poor Bill, who was sitting on the bench. The cut in his
head had stopped bleeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re no more sorry than I am,&#8221; declared the pitcher
ruefully. &#8220;But it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may have to call on you yet,&#8221; said the coach, &#8220;if
they knock Mersfeld and Newton out of the box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I couldn&#8217;t do much good,&#8221; was Bill&#8217;s doleful
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play ball!&#8221; howled the umpire, and the players took
their places, Mersfeld catching the new white horsehide
sphere the official tossed to him.</p>

<p>The first ball which Mersfeld delivered was cleanly hit
away out in centrefield, and when it came back the batter
was on second base. There was a wild riot of cheers at
this auspicious opening for Tuckerton, and a grim look on
the faces of the Westfield players.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks bad,&#8221; murmured Bill, as he watched Mersfeld
wind up for his next delivery. The pitcher was visibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
nervous, and Cap, seeing it, made an excuse to walk
out to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep cool!&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;or you won&#8217;t last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mersfeld stiffened, and struck out the next man. But
the third one got a three bagger out of him, and the following
one a single. When the inning came to a close
there were three runs chalked up for the rivals of our
friends, and there was only gloom for the home team.
Nor was it dissipated by the triumphant songs their opponents
sang.</p>

<p>One run was the best that Graydon&#8217;s men could do on
their first trial, though captain and coach pleaded earnestly
with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they&#8217;ve got our number,&#8221; murmured Pete to
his brother as the latter donned his protector and mask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be so gloomy,&#8221; was the advice.</p>

<p>Mersfeld went from bad to worse, and at the beginning
of the fourth inning the captain and coach held a consultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do something,&#8221; said Graydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you. But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Newton will have to go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks so. We can&#8217;t chance Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Well, tell Newton to pitch next inning.&#8221; Two
more runs went to the credit of Tuckerton, making the
score eight to two in their favor.</p>

<p>By desperate playing and taking several chances our
friends managed to pull a brace of tallies out of the ruck
that inning, so that there was some hope. Mersfeld sulked
when told to go to the bench, and pleaded for another
chance, but the coach and captain were firm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>&#8220;Get ready, Newton,&#8221; ordered Graydon.</p>

<p>The substitute Varsity twirler was not a wonder, and he
knew it, but he started off well, and there was some hope,
until he began to go to pieces after issuing passes to two
men. Then it seemed all up with him, though only one
run went to Tuckerton&#8217;s credit that inning.</p>

<p>Cap shook his head dubiously when he took off his mask
at the beginning of the second half of the fifth inning.
His apprehensive feeling was shared by his teammates, by
the coach, the manager and by thousands of the Westfield
supporters, who sat in gloomy silence while the cohorts of
Tuckerton yelled, shouted and sang themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do something desperate,&#8221; declared the
coach, to the captain, when two runs had come in to
sweeten the tally for Westfield, thereby causing wild hope
among her friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked Graydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know we can beat these fellows, even now, if we could
only hold them down to no more runs,&#8221; went on Windam.
&#8220;And to shut them out for the rest of the game we need
a good pitcher. Mersfeld can&#8217;t do it, Newton doesn&#8217;t
count, Bill is out of it, and I&#8217;m going to put in Morgan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! The Freshman sub?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a last hope, I know,&#8221; admitted the coach, &#8220;but we&#8217;ve
got to do something. Morgan is good, and if he can last
he&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rather listlessly, and almost hopelessly the captain consented
to it. He was crossing to tell Morgan of the decision
arrived at, when he noticed that Cap and Bill were
having a little warm-up practice off to one side, for it
would not be Cap&#8217;s turn to bat in some time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>As Bill stung in a ball his brother uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter&mdash;hurt?&#8221; asked the captain quickly,
fearing more bad luck. With his best catcher laid off, as
well as the star pitcher, the game might as well be given
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt! No, I&#8217;m not hurt,&#8221; answered Cap. &#8220;Here,
Bill just throw a few more that way,&#8221; he called eagerly to
his brother.</p>

<p>Bill, wondering what was up, did so, fairly stinging
them in with his old-time force. The look of surprise on
Cap&#8217;s face grew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he called to the captain, and he motioned for
Bill to approach. &#8220;Do you notice any difference in your
eyes?&#8221; he asked his brother eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My eyes?&#8221; repeated Bill, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;His eyes,&#8221; murmured the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; went on the catcher. &#8220;Every ball you threw
came in as straight as a die, and the curve broke just at
the right time. Say, maybe I&#8217;m loony, or dreaming, but
you pitch just as you used to, Bill, before you got hurt!
Do your eyes feel any differently?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they don&#8217;t ache as they used to when I pitched
without my glasses, and there seems to be a queer feeling
in my head.&#8221; He put his hand back to where he had
fallen on the stone a little while before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, you&#8217;ve got your eyesight back!&#8221; cried Cap eagerly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really believe it?&#8221; asked the pitcher trembling
with suppressed hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. But we&#8217;ll try once more. Come over here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>The game was going rather slow now, for the Tuckerton
pitcher was tiring, and was not sure of his man. He had
decided to walk him, and to kill time was playing with
Whistle-Breeches, who was on second. Consequently little
attention needed to be given to the contest for the moment
by the captain. He could see what Cap and Bill were going
to do.</p>

<p>Once more Bill threw in the balls. They came just as
they had formerly done, perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do!&#8221; cried Cap in delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get ready to go to the box!&#8221; ordered the captain
tensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; stammered the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your sight back!&#8221; went on his brother, &#8220;and
I believe what did it was the fall you just had. It did
something to your head&mdash;relieved the blood or nerve pressure
or something. Anyhow you can pitch once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; cried Graydon. &#8220;We need you!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a wild yell from the grandstands, and out
burst a chorus of a Westfield song.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whistle-Breeches brought in a run,&#8221; cried Graydon.
&#8220;Things are picking up! Now we&#8217;ll wallop &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Three runs were the best Westfield could do that inning
and when the home team was ready to take the field there
was a murmur of surprise as it was announced that Bill
Smith would pitch.</p>

<p>As Bill started toward the box there was some excitement
at one of the entrance gates near the grandstand
back of the home plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go in! I must go in!&#8221; a voice cried. &#8220;I tell you
the Smith boys need me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>Something in the voice attracted the attention of Bill,
Cap and Pete. They looked, and saw Professor Clatter
rush past a ticket-taker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am!&#8221; cried the medicine man. &#8220;I came on as
soon as I could. I got your message in Langfield. And
here are your glasses, Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>He held up the case containing the missing spectacles,
and fairly ran across the diamond.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> game was halted. There were angry demands from
several players as to why a stranger was allowed to come on
the field. Others, recognizing the professor, clamored
that it was all right.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came as soon as I could!&#8221; explained the medicine
man to the Smith boys, who gathered about him. &#8220;I knew
something must be wrong. I can&#8217;t locate Tithonus
though. What is it? Bill&#8217;s glasses? Here they are,
found in the most opportune way! Talk about golden
rivers!&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor was panting from his run and his rapid
talk. He held the glasses to Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you find them?&#8221; gasped the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now, as I was coming across the campus. I left
my wagon over in the road. As I was passing one of the
cannon some of the janitors were cleaning it. There was
a lot of leaves and rubbish in it. Then out fell the
glasses just as I passed. I grabbed them up, and I knew
the whole story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew the whole story?&#8221; cried Cap. &#8220;Who put
them there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! I can&#8217;t tell that!&#8221; declared Mr. Clatter,
while North and Mersfeld looked at each other in relief.
&#8220;I mean I understand it all&mdash;about your messages to me,&#8221;
went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> on the medicine man. &#8220;At first I couldn&#8217;t imagine
why you had telegraphed me. I knew you must be in some
kind of trouble though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we generally are,&#8221; murmured Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, as soon as I saw the glasses fall from the cannon
I realized what it was. Bill lost them, perhaps a bird took
them for its nest. At any rate here they are, and it&#8217;s very
lucky, too, for I can&#8217;t get any trace of Tithy. Here, Bill,
put them on and play ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need them now,&#8221; answered the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need them! You don&#8217;t mean to say that the
game is over&mdash;you haven&#8217;t lost the championship; have
you?&#8221; and the professor looked pained, for he was a lover
of base ball, and in his journeyings he faithfully read the
accounts of the games at Westfield, where his friends the
Smith boys attended. &#8220;Have you lost the pennant?&#8221;
asked the professor sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, but we&#8217;re in a fair way to if this keeps on,&#8221;
murmured Cap, for the score was seven to nine in favor
of Tuckerton.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why doesn&#8217;t Bill need his glasses then?&#8221; asked Mr.
Clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I can see to pitch without them,&#8221; answered our
hero. &#8220;A funny thing just happened, Professor,&#8221; and Bill
told about his fall and the odd effect it had had on his
vision. The traveling medicine man looked interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s exactly how it may have taken place,&#8221; he
declared, as Cap stated his theory. &#8220;Here, let me have
a look at you, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; angrily cried Burke, captain of the Tuckerton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
nine, &#8220;if this is a ball game let&#8217;s go on with it, and if
it&#8217;s a hospital for injured players we&#8217;ll get off the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; added Hedden, the pitcher. &#8220;We&#8217;re here
to win the pennant, not to listen to fairy stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play ball!&#8221; yelled Brower, the catcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy now,&#8221; counseled Professor Clatter. &#8220;It won&#8217;t
take me but a moment to look at Bill&#8217;s head, and then the
game can go on. You don&#8217;t seem to realize that something
extraordinary has taken place here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be extraordinary if we ever play ball again,&#8221;
remarked Burke, sarcastically. But the professor did not
heed him. He was looking at the cut on Bill&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That accounts for your eyes getting right again,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bad cut, but you&#8217;re in shape to play, in spite
of it. Go in, and win!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do!&#8221; declared Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know!&#8221; cried Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to find out how my glasses got in that cannon,&#8221;
spoke Bill, but no one enlightened him, though Professor
Clatter, as he looked at the guilty, flushed face of Mersfeld
had a suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play ball!&#8221; called the umpire, and the Westfield nine
went to their places in the field. Mersfeld, with a bitter
look on his face, watched Bill go to the box.</p>

<p>And the pitcher did not need his glasses, though he took
them with him as a matter of precaution. With his eyes
right once more, and feeling full of confidence Bill exchanged
a few preliminary balls with Cap. Then he signified
that he was ready for the batter. Cap, with a gratified
smile, had noticed that the horsehide cut the plate
cleanly and yet the curves broke just at the right time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>&#8220;Strike one!&#8221; called the umpire suddenly, following the
first ball Bill delivered. The batter started. He had not
moved his stick. He gave the umpire an indignant glance,
opened his mouth as if to say something, and then thought
better of it.</p>

<p>There was a long-drawn sigh of relief from the grandstands
and bleachers where the Westfield supporters sat,
and Bob Chapin ventured to start the song, &#8220;We&#8217;ve Got
Their Scalp Locks Now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill smiled at his brother behind the plate. Pete picked
up a handful of gravel and tossed it into the air before settling
back ready for whatever might come his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike two!&#8221; came sharply from the umpire.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to do it! Make him fan, Bill!&#8221; cried
Whistle-Breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done,&#8221; called Bob Chapin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make him give you a nice one,&#8221; was the advice the
batter got from his friends.</p>

<p>The man with the stick tapped the plate and smiled confidently.
He was still smiling when the next ball came.
He struck at it&mdash;missed it clean, and threw his bat to the
ground with such force as to splinter it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Batter&#8217;s out!&#8221; said the umpire quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more where those came from!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got their Angora!&#8221;</p>

<p>These were the cries that greeted Bill&#8217;s initial effort in
the box at that championship game. Matters were looking
brighter for Westfield, and every man on the team, and
every supporter who wanted to see the pennant stay where
it was, felt hope coming back to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>There was a little apprehension in Tuckerton&#8217;s ranks.
The game had seemed so sure to them, but now the tide
was turning. Still Bill might not be able to keep it up.</p>

<p>As for our hero, however, he knew that his eye was as
true as it had ever been, and he felt able to go on for
nine innings if necessary. But only four remained in
which to turn the trick. Could he do it? Others beside
himself asked that question.</p>

<p>The next man stepped to the plate. Two fouls and a
miss on the last strike was the best he could do, and he
went back to the bench. The third man Bill struck out
cleanly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! Wow!&#8221; howled the Westfield crowd. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got &#8217;em going!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was to be no easy victory. Though by reason of
Bill&#8217;s twirling a momentary halt had been called on the
winning streak of the visitors, still Westfield must make
more runs in order to win the game.</p>

<p>And this was not easy. Hedden was hit for two singles,
but the Westfield players were a bit careless on bases,
and one was caught napping. One run was brought in
on Cap&#8217;s three bagger making the score eight to nine,
with a single leading tally in favor of the visitors.</p>

<p>From then on it was nip and tuck for victory. Bill
kept up the good twirling, and such box work as he exhibited
was not seen for many a long day on the Westfield
diamond. Not a Tuckerton player got a hit off
him in the next three innings, goose eggs going up in
the frames, that up to the advent of Bill had contained
at least one tally for each time the visitors were at bat.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand Westfield, try as they did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
could not score. The captain and coach begged and
pleaded, and the crowds by songs and cheers urged their
men to battle to the death. It seemed useless. The
two teams, now evenly matched, sea-sawed back and forth,
with grim, bulldog tenacity, but there the game hung in
the balance.</p>

<p>Tuckerton was still one run ahead when they came to
bat in the ninth inning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold &#8217;em down! Hold &#8217;em down!&#8221; pleaded Cap to
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised the pitcher, and he did, striking
three men out in quick succession amid the cheers of the
crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s our last chance,&#8221; murmured Captain Graydon
as his men came in. &#8220;It&#8217;s do or die for the pennant
now!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">WINNING THE PENNANT</p>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">One</span> run to tie, two to win and three to make a
good job of it,&#8221; murmured Cap, as he walked to the
bench with his brothers. &#8220;Can we do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; answered Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make a home run, I&#8217;ll limp along after you,
and Pete can follow,&#8221; suggested Bill. &#8220;That will do
the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might happen,&#8221; said Cap. &#8220;Whistle-Breeches is
up first, then I follow, and, after Graydon has a
whack, you and Pete come along, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t talk about it!&#8221; exclaimed the pitcher. &#8220;It
makes me nervous,&#8221; but he did not show any signs of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are your eyes?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I feel fine. But I&#8217;d like to know who hid
my glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Batter up!&#8221; called the umpire, and Whistle-Breeches, a
little pale because of what depended on his work, walked to
the plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now line out a good one!&#8221; counseled the coach.
&#8220;You can do it. Wait for a nice one.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was good advice, and well meant, but alas! Whistle-Breeches
fanned the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;One down!&#8221; exulted the captain of the Tuckerton nine.
&#8220;We only need two more!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t get me!&#8221; murmured Cap, with a grim
tightening of his mouth. And he made good. A pretty
two-bagger was his contribution, and he got to third on
a little fly which Graydon knocked, but the captain was out
at first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two down, play for the batter!&#8221; called Burke.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve only got one chance, and they can&#8217;t make good.
The pennant comes to Tuckerton!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fool yourself,&#8221; murmured Bill, as he went to
the plate. Hedden, his rival pitcher, regarded him with a
mocking smile. Bill was not especially strong in stick
work, but somehow he felt that he was going to make good
to-day.</p>

<p>He saw a ball coming, and sized it up for a slow out.
Knowing the peculiarity of the curve which Hedden pitched
Bill stepped right into it. His bat met the horsehide
squarely, and with a &#8220;Ping!&#8221; that sent a thrill of joy not
only to his heart but to the hearts of his brothers and
friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right on the nose! Oh, what a poke!&#8221; cried Whistle-Breeches
who rejoiced for Bill over what he himself could
not do.</p>

<p>Away sailed the ball, well over the centre fielder&#8217;s head,
away sped Bill legging it for first with all the speed of
which he was capable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Run! Run!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on in, Cap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh what a poke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty! Pretty!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd on the stands was yelling and jumping up and
down. Old men were tossing their hats into the air, clapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
each other on the back, making friends with strangers,
and telling each other that it reminded them of the time
when they were boys.</p>

<p>Bill swung around second, as Cap fairly leaped over
home plate, bringing in the tying run. The Tuckerton
players were wild with chagrin. The game was being
pulled out of the fire&mdash;snatched from them at the moment
when they thought they saw a safe victory. The centre
fielder nearly had the ball now, and Bill was heading for
third base.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on! Go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home! Home!&#8221;</p>

<p>This and other advice was shouted at him. He gave a
quick glance around, and decided that he would risk it
by going on to the last bag. It was a narrow chance, almost
too narrow, and Bill had to slide so far that his uniform
took on a new shade, and his mouth and eyes were filled
with dust and gravel, for the ball whizzed into the hands
of the eager baseman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe!&#8221; decided the umpire after a breathless run to
third that he might see the outcome.</p>

<p>The score was now tied!</p>

<p>There was a howl of disgust from the Tuckerton crowd
but the decision stood, and there was wild rejoicing on the
part of the Westfield throng.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, Pete, it&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; said the coach solemnly
as the third member of the Smith boys trio stepped
to the bat. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t bring Bill in at least, I&#8217;ll never
speak to you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; declared the doughty little shortstop.
He was one of the best men who could have been up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
an emergency of this kind, with two out, a man on third
and the winning run still needed. For Pete was as cool
as the proverbial cucumber.</p>

<p>He smiled in a tantalizing fashion at the Tuckerton
pitcher, who was on the verge of a nervous breakdown because
of the many epithets hurled at him, in an endeavor to
&#8220;get his goat.&#8221; He had to watch Bill carefully, for that
worthy was playing off as far as he dared, hoping to slip
in with the needed winning run. The catcher, too, was
fearful lest some ball get by him, and had told the pitcher
to be on the alert to run in instantly in the event of a
passed ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ball one!&#8221; howled the umpire, as Hedden threw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh wow! He&#8217;s going to walk you, Pete!&#8221; called Graydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a pass!&#8221; shouted Bob Chapin.</p>

<p>Pete smiled cheerfully. He thought the next ball looked
good, and swung at it, but he had been fooled by a neat
trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike one!&#8221; said the umpire, and a breathless silence
followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two more like that and we&#8217;ve got &#8217;em!&#8221; called the
catcher to Hedden. &#8220;You can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pitcher nodded. He threw the swiftest ball of
which he was capable. It came almost before Pete was
ready for it, but with the quickness of light he swung on
it.</p>

<p>Oh what a &#8220;Ping!&#8221; followed, and he knew that he had
made good. Once more, amid the frenzied howls of the
crowd, the ball sailed outward and upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, Oh Bill! Where are you? Come in! Come in!&#8221;
pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> scores to him. But the pitcher did not need these
entreaties. On he came running as he had never run before.
The catcher, to disconcert him, stood as though to
catch the ball. Bill dared not look around to make sure
that it had not been caught and thrown home. Brower
was right in his path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slide!&#8221; some one called to him, and for the second time
that day Bill dropped and shot forward on the ground.
His hand touched the plate, and he knew that he was safe,
for he had not heard the thud of the ball in the catcher&#8217;s
mitt. Then, he felt some heavy body fall on him, and for
the moment the breath was knocked from him, and he lost
consciousness. He had knocked the catcher&#8217;s feet from
under him, and toppled that player in the dust.</p>

<p>Cap ran to pick up his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt?&#8221; he cried anxiously. &#8220;Oh Bill, you did it! We
win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;n-not much hurt!&#8221; gasped Bill. &#8220;Just&mdash;just a
little&mdash;little short&mdash;of wind&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>They gave him water and he felt better, and then he
looked out over the diamond. Pete had reached third,
and was still running. Around the last bag he swung, but
the right fielder far on amid the daisies had the ball now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back! Go back!&#8221; howled Graydon, for, though the
game was won he wanted to pile up another run against
Tuckerton if he could.</p>

<p>But Pete did not heed. The ball had been thrown, but
the fielder had to run so far back for it, that he could
not get it far enough in. There was just a chance for Pete
to make a home run, and he took that chance.</p>

<p>The horsehide fell short of the second baseman, who ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
to get it. By this time Pete was half way home, and running
well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on! Come on!&#8221; pleaded hundreds to him, and
Pete came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slide!&#8221; cried the coach, and, as Bill had done, so did
Pete, but with more cause.</p>

<p>On came the ball, thrown swiftly by the second baseman.
Pete was hurtling forward through a cloud of dust, his
hand eagerly stretched out to feel the plate. His fingers
touched it, and a welcome thrill ran through him, just as
he heard the thud of the ball in the catcher&#8217;s glove. Down
came the horsehide on his shoulder with vicious force.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s it?&#8221; excitedly yelled the catcher to the umpire.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, and the players and
crowd hardly breathed. It seemed as if the weight of
kingdoms hung on the decision, and Pete lay there waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe!&#8221; decided the umpire, and yells of delight mingled
with those of chagrin. Westfield had the game now by two
runs and the pennant remained with them.</p>

<p>Oh what rejoicing there was! No need to play the
game out farther. Indeed it could scarcely have been
done had the coach or captain desired it, so wild with delight
were the members of the nine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you Smith boys!&#8221; was the gladsome cry, and around
our heroes there danced a wild and enthusiastic mob of
players of the game. Horns tooted, rattles added their
din, old men, youths and maidens swelled the riot with
their voices, the shrill tones of the girls sounding high
above the hoarser notes of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;We win! We win!&#8221; cried Graydon, hugging the rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
grave and sedate coach, and whirling him about in a
dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and at the last minute,&#8221; added Mr. Windam.
&#8220;That was a lucky fall of Bill Smith&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was crooked work somewhere,&#8221; said the captain
in a low voice. &#8220;Those glasses never fell into the cannon,
and I know whom to suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then keep it to yourself,&#8221; advised the coach, and
Graydon did so.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that it was all over, that the school
baseball season was at an end, and that Westfield still had
the pennant, yet such was the case. Already the crowds
were leaving the grandstands. Students were gathering
in groups to cheer over, or sing about, the victory. The
team was hugged and hustled here and there. The Smith
boys and their mates were lifted to the shoulders of their
fellows and paraded about the diamond. The Tuckertons
had given a cheer for the victors, and, in turn, had been
cheered for their plucky fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think that this is the end of the season,&#8221; remarked
Bill regretfully to his brothers, as they walked over
toward the gymnasium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but it will soon be fall, and then for the good old
pigskin punts!&#8221; exclaimed Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. I wonder if we can make the eleven?&#8221;
said Cap. &#8220;I hope we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try, anyhow,&#8221; declared Bill.</p>

<p>How they tried, and with what success they had will
be told of in the third volume of this series to be called
&#8220;Those Smith Boys on the Gridiron; or A Touchdown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Time.&#8221; In that book we will meet with our school friends
again, and learn how they played several great games.</p>

<p>As Bill and his brothers strolled across the campus they
saw a group of girls coming toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh cats!&#8221; exclaimed Bill. &#8220;I look like sin; don&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you cleaner,&#8221; answered Whistle-Breeches, as
he noted Bill&#8217;s torn jacket and dusty trousers. &#8220;But what&#8217;s
the odds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Miss Morton,&#8221; murmured the pitcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried the girl, with whom he had once rode at
such top speed to play in the Freshman game. &#8220;Oh, I
want to shake hands with all you boys! Wasn&#8217;t it perfectly
splendid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you think so!&#8221; mumbled Bill, trying to hide behind
Cap. But Miss Morton would have none of that.
She held out her hand to Bill especially.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll spoil your gloves!&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if I cared for them!&#8221; and she only laughed at the
grimy stains which Bill made on the white kids. Then,
in turn she and the other young ladies greeted our friends,
and repeated, over and over again, in more or less emphatic
words, what they thought of the victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;And may I add a word,&#8221; spoke a voice, as the girls
moved off. The boys turned to behold Professor Clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was fine!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Not even by the use if my
Rapid Robust Resolute Resolvent, my Peerless, Permanent
Pain Preventive or my Spotless Saponifier could a more
noble victory have been won. I congratulate you. Pactolus
congratulates you, and when we find the golden river
we&#8217;ll make a crown of victory for you. But what I want
to add most especially is, that our mutual friend Tithonus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Somnus has just arrived. His wagon is over near mine,
and he and I entreat you to come and see us, and partake
of such humble fare as we may afford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean all of us?&#8221; asked Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;The entire nine!&#8221; cried the medicine man warmly.
&#8220;We will dine out of doors, and Mercurio will serve the
viands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What say, fellows; shall we go?&#8221; asked Cap, for the
members of the Varsity team were gathered about the
Smith boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go? Of course,&#8221; answered Graydon. &#8220;We can break
training now, and we&#8217;ll eat golden rivers or Resolute Resolvent
or even Spotless Saponifiers! Lead on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say Tithy has arrived?&#8221; asked Bill, as the little
throng moved over the campus, it having been arranged
that as soon as they got off their uniforms they would go to
the professor&#8217;s wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he heard that I was headed here, and followed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business is he in now?&#8221; inquired Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is selling a wonderful instrument. It is a
pocket knife, a glass cutter, a can opener, hammer, screw
driver, and twenty-six other tools, more or less, combined
into one. Tithy is enthusiastic over it. Well, I&#8217;ll go to
tell him you are coming, and then I will bid Mercurio set
the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor, with a low bow, turned away, and hastened
off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer chap,&#8221; commented Graydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But as good as gold,&#8221; added Bill, and his brothers
agreed with him. &#8220;To think of him finding my glasses. I
wonder how they got there?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>No one answered him, and Mersfeld and North did not
hear the question. Perhaps they would not have replied
had they listened to it.</p>

<p>A little later the members of the nine were seated in
the shade of the two queer wagons, on the long, green grass,
beside the road, partaking of the hospitality of Professor
Clatter and Tithonus Somnus, who gravely announced that
he had changed his name, as well as his trade and that
thenceforth he would be known as Cornelius Cutaby.</p>

<p>Proudly he showed the new implement for which he was
traveling agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do anything from cutting glass to taking an automobile
apart,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if it will open some more of that ginger ale,
I&#8217;ll be glad of it,&#8221; remarked Bill. &#8220;These olives and ham
sandwiches make me thirsty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ho! Mercurio!&#8221; called Professor Clatter. &#8220;Pass
the ginger ale,&#8221; and, having executed his own command
he opened the bottles with the combined glass cutter and
screw driver, and served to his friends the frothing beverage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now fellows, for the baseball song&mdash;&#8216;Strike &#8217;em Out
and Run &#8217;em Down!&#8217; and then we&#8217;ll go back to school
and get ready for the celebration to-night!&#8221; suggested
Cap, after a pause.</p>

<p>The improvised banquet was over. In the twilight the
boys stood up, and softly sang the time-honored song of
Westfield, sung whenever there was a victory. Professor
Clatter brought out a guitar and played the accompaniment,
and Tithy&mdash;I beg his pardon, Cornelius Cutaby&mdash;joined
in the chorus.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>And now, for a time, we will take leave of Those Smith
Boys, though if the fates are kind, they may be met with
again, as well as the professor and the traveling agent for
the combined glass cutter and monkey wrench.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
